{"id":"ENG-314","label":"GEN","alpha":"a","text":"<__URL__ misuse-of-laws?signed=true> women misusing laws against men in india for extortion, manipulation and revenge\/vendetta has become an epidemic that not only threatens the moral fabric of our society but puts lacs of innocent men behind bars. lacs of innocent men are languishing behind bars in overcrowded jails, and there are no laws to protect them or legal body to hear their anguish and support them. our constitution states that we are all equal irrespective of caste, colour or gender. however, we have laws that only protect women and no parallel laws to protect men. in fact, pro-women laws are being misused to victimise men and men have no real recourse under law. we need to put deterrents in place to prevent misuse of laws, victimisation of men, and also to ensure gender neutral laws are put in place. #mentoo with pooja bedi intends to push lawmakers to draft legislation in parliament to create checks and balances in society that give men and their families equal protection under law and punishment to those who misuse laws. please note; #mentoo is not anti #metoo. women who misuse laws and file false cases are a deterrent to women empowerment movements. what needs to change????? 1\\. name of accused to be kept as confidential as victims name until proven guilty. a woman who files a rape complaint gets her identity protected but the men carry the hashtag of #rapist from moment case is registered. not just them, the women in their families be it mother, sister, wife, daughter all bear the brunt of his rapist hashtag. shockingly if case is proven false, no real punishment is meted out the woman who has destroyed the life, career, reputation of the man and put him and his family through mental, emotional and physical torture. punishment for the woman can be a mere 500 rupees.statistics are shocking. data by the delhi commission for women states 53.2% of rape cases filed in delhi between april 2013 and july 2014 turned out to be false. 2\\. rape\/ domestic violence cases filed post 3 months of date of alleged rape\/abuse to be treated differently and arrest only after investigation of the same. most fake cases are filed after deliberation, plotting and connivance with friends, family and lawyers. statistics claim almost 75 % of dv cases are false and according to ncrb data, 10% dowry cases filed each year are proven false. there are over 11 lac men languishing in jails implicated in false cases. in 2013, out of the investigated 1,12,058 cases, 10,864 were false. and in 2012, 10,235 out of 1,03,848 were proven false. after this data was released, the supreme court had observed that the law meant to combat the menace of harassment of women by their husband or in-laws was often being used as a \u201cweapon rather than shield by disgruntled wives\u201d. the ipc 498a being a cognisable and non-bailable offence only worsens the plight of those falsely accused. sections 354, 509 and 376 are there to protect women, and not to terrorise innocent men. 3\\. severe penalty to put in place for women who have been proven to have filed a fake case as deterrent to others. please note: there is a distinction between an acqquital on grounds of insufficient evidence and when it is a proven false case. 4\\. creation of national commission for men. if women have a body that addresses their issues we need one in place for men as well. data states that for for every 16 women who commit suicide 25 men commit suicide. 5\\. introduce purushdhan which will give a man the same economic rights and footing as streedhan. many cases are coming to light of women marrying men and within a few months demanding divorce and large sums of money. they threaten a man and his family under sections of 376, 354, 509 and 498a if they don't comply. the assets a man is given by his famliy or what he has earned prior to marriage should be considered his. only what is earned during their marriage should be part of a divorce proceeding based on number of years spent together and whether kids are involved. 6\\. right to prenuptial agreements currently pre nups are not legal as it absurdly gets challenged under bonded labour laws. men are increasingly shying away from marriage as it means extortion. clarity on money will bring rights and respect to both. 7\\. to clearly define rape there have been judgements stating that if a man is in a live in relationship it can fall under rape. promise to marry and not marrying is equivalent to rape. rape is a heinous crime and laws for it are stringent. we need to clearly define rape. 8\\. palimony to be taken as seriously as alimony. if a man is not earning and a woman is, he should be entitled to palimony with the same respect and laws that grant a woman alimony. 9\\. gender neutral laws to be implemented when men face domestic violence there is no law to support them even if they submit videographic evidence. same with rape. men on men rape and women on men rape needs to recognised especically when rape is defined as intercourse under threat\/coercion. also for sexual harassment laws in the workplace to be gender neutral. men in india have been imprisoned not only by gender stereotyping but also a lack of laws and no official body to hear their cries. men are human. and if we want an equal society, equal relationships, equal justice, we need equal laws. please support our petition and lets push for equality and justice thank you so so so much"}

**i came out as a gay man because i had no choice** i opened up about my sexuality and everything to everyone including my parents , my brothers, my boss, my teachers , everyone ! i was not going to take this woman's shit anymore. i showed all my sex chats to the world with all the men i had it with, called all the guys whom i hooked up with, showed all my pictures of me being gay ever since i realised my sexuality at age 14 and the bullying i suffered as a child. i didn't stop there ! i called up my ex and asked him to show the videos were we kissed, had cosy consented adult time together, showed proofs of gay bar visits in us , finland, israel and all places that i visited. and asked her if she wanted to really marry me if i keep having sex with men and be her husband at the same time, she was even more shocked than she could ever even dream of ! gay men (90% of the time) are masculine and you would never even know that they're gay until they say it themselves. most indian gay men by age 35 , almost 99% marry women to hide their sexuality. i'm of the remainder 1% who are proud of themselves. found out this woman had a child already 5 years younger to me , already. lesson learnt : never even befriend a girl or be her companion in her bad times, you might end up being called a rapist. lol, i can't even imagine seeing a woman nude , let alone touching her , i literally keep a hand on the part in the porn where naked girls are around hot naked men to avoid any visual encounter. my heart beats out for all my heterosexual brothers who have faced such female molestation or rape charges, even worse if they ever consensual sex , because the man is screwed now for life ! i saved myself because i was gay , ya'll have no hopes ! i also feel bad for girls who have been victims of rape by men, i won't be biased at all. women do face more of sexual assaults than us men do, no point in denial but there are many a times , men are victims of it themselves. imagine. showing your relatives, your sex videos with other people to prove your sexuality just **so that nobody calls me a rapist** i knew those charges would be useless but once an allegation always is a charge especially if it's a male. \"woh dekho wo launde ko, shadi shuda aurat ka rape kiya usne\" nobody would believe me even if i were to be free from all that legally. took quick action, saved my family from all that shame . i'm not ashamed of being a gay man, because i made my life out being called a chakka, hijda, what not by my own brothers, nobody accepted me not even my straight bestfriend as i grew up because i trusted them and they ditched me , as a result i began engulfing my own self either by suffering it or having sex with other men who would comfort me or play with me for some days in my teenage years and support me emotionally and cry lonely in the showers and beat myself ,cursing being a unlucky shame to the family. while my brothers who did nothing significant didn't have to prove themselves just because they're straight. many of my relatives distanced me since we are a conservative family what matters is my own family, took no shame of me. my employers know my hardwork, my friends know my value, my neighbours know my support. found immense respect socially. actually ,even more after coming out. my prayers with all rape victims of whatever gender, even more with the gay men because nobody even reports it if it has been done out of society. most of teenage gay men are sexually assaulted by their own heterosexual cousins or had some encounter. you have no idea the trauma gay men suffer as children being excluded from the world. drying within, most marry women by adulthood just so that their parents have their dreams fulfilled , drinking their own self sacrifice of being at freewill as venom. don't blame them, blame each and every indian citizen for that. imagine being a victim , where court deemed us as criminals, religions admonished us, families throwing us out, brothers beating us, our mothers love us but they have no choice . god bless you if you've read this far. i'm just like your brother, son, begin accepting us for who we are , this will save a lot of devastation from your own human fellow being."}

{"id":"ENG-789","label":"GEN","alpha":"a","text":"\u200b@USER see, it is just my personal opinion , but it would be better if you do not use the over-used words such as 'feminist', 'male entitlement', and 'toxic' when you argue against this movie(or the mentality that has become this movie). the reason is that there is so much of bullshit that is attached with the definition of these words, most of it coming from the privileged but dumb american left and most of the issues that are raised using those words are concerning only the educated financially independent upper middle class white women. in india, where there are communities and citizens that have only slowly started to understand that women are also human beings and not just properties, we are eons and eons behind the west in the basic understanding of human rights. so when you appropriate such academic words to the indian context, there would be a huge distortion in the message you want to convey, not to mention the meaning lost due to cultural differences. where in the west their first world issue is to have the right to be topless in public, in india the public have yet to acknowledge the basic right of a woman to choose what she wants to wear. furthermore, these words have been parrotted within and without context so often, that it could mean just about anything but basic right of a woman for respect, dignity and freedom in the society, especially in a country like india, where there are women that belong to a wide variety of economic classes, not to mention segregations based on caste. what i have also observed is that the conservatives of india have also started to appropriate the words and arguments of the western conservatives, like 'libtards', to nullify such criticisms as against kabir singh. which they would do easily, because what they are basically nullifying is the dumb arguments of american left appropriated by the indian liberals. the american left liberals are nowhere near as rational or educated as indian liberals, leftists and centrists, while the american conservatives are far more progressive when compared to the indian conservatives( who are just a bunch of undemocratic dumb savages). instead of directly using those words in the arguments, arguing using the rationale behind those words, while keeping in mind the reality of how deep such discriminations are etched in the fabric of our indian society, would do more more good, i guess. not for the sake of winning the argument, nor in the hope that these dumb idiots would understand it somehow. but for the rational people who still has a flicker of humanity in them, to read such arguments and spread the message."}
