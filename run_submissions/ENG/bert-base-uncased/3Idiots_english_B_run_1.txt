This is submission 1 for language english for Sub-task B.
The submission was generated using the bert-base-uncased transformer model. 
The model only used the text as a feature for prediction. 

Only data from english language was used for training.

For this prediction we combined labels for subtasks A and B. 
Then the model was trained to predict the combined labels. 
The combined predicted labels were then splitted to identify the subtask specific labels. 
The combined label prediction task is referred to as subtask C by us. 
This model results in predicted probabilities for each combined label. 

For this model the marginal probabilities of labels for subtask B are computed.
Then the label with the highest marginal probability is used to identify the predicted label for this subtask.
