This is submission 2 for language hindi for Sub-task A.
The submission was generated using the bert-base-multilingual-uncased transformer model. 
The model only used the text as a feature for prediction. 

This model was trained on texts from all languages. 
For this submission a multilingual model was used. 
The model was then used to predict labels for each language.


For this prediction we combined labels for subtasks A and B. 
Then the model was trained to predict the combined labels. 
The combined predicted labels were then splitted to identify the subtask specific labels. 
The combined label prediction task is referred to as subtask C by us. 
This model results in predicted probabilities for each combined label. 


The label with the highest probability is selected as the predicted label. 
The subtask A component of this predicted label is used as a prediction for this subtask.
