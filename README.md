# Multilingual Joint Fine-tuning of Transformer models for identifying Trolling, Aggression and Cyberbullying at TRAC 2020

Models and predictions for submission to TRAC - 2020 Second Workshop on Trolling, Aggression and Cyberbullying

Our approach is described in our paper titled: 

> Mishra, Sudhanshu, Shivangi Prasad, and Shubhanshu Mishra. 2020. "Multilingual Joint Fine-Tuning of Transformer Models for Identifying Trolling, Aggression and Cyberbullying at TRAC 2020." In Proceedings of the Second Workshop on Trolling, Aggression and Cyberbullying (TRAC-2020).

The source code for training this model and more details can be found on our code repository: https://github.com/socialmediaie/TRAC2020

NOTE: These models are retrained for uploading here after our submission so the evaluation measures may be slightly different from the ones reported in the paper.
