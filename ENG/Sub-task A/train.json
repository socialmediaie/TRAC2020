And you dont go to theatre in india for some reality shit and if u really seek reality and logical scripts and characters without plotholes and all then you wouldnt be watching kabir singh. So I think you just made this for views, cause theres no need for this so called raw review.

I personally abhor this propaganda infused right-wing program and have reported it multiple times. It's in the best interest of the nation if it ceases to exist from the digital platforms and is confined to television only. Nevertheless, needed to get certain thoughts off of my chest so here goes: 1\\. Stop broadcasting these staged debates that resemble poorly produced b-grade flicks at best. The background score during the intro, the participants who are more like the bickering neighborhood aunties than dignified panelists, etc. stink of sub-standard nonsense. Stop fooling the public. 2\\. Instead of all this nonsense, why the hell can't you show how the PM and Home Minister have successfully confused the nation and are literally behaving like clueless self-contradicting juveniles? 3\\. With a few days left for 2020, our nation is yet to overcome the confines of religion. I had high hopes for my country and had started believing that we would achieve great heights in the field of Science and Technology that would put us in the big leagues, but no, we are all weighed down by this archaic concept (read religion) and have ensured that progress is a goal that is quite far from our reaches. A note to Republic TV: Instead of showing all this nonsense about anti-nationals, lutyens and what not please focus on key items that are deterring our nation (unemployment, poor economy,etc.). The mass does not care about the sub-standard reporting you do on these ridiculous theories. They want some concrete information that the news channels alone can provide."}

Thirdly, by saying i like thia girl in particular clothing and then going from class to class plus the girl's hostel and giving it the name of love isn't love at all and it's CREEPY like srk chasing after kajol in DDLJ. Fourth point, after repeated pleas by his parents, he still drinks and smokes. He was shown in a negative light....but atleast there was a courtroom scene. And he is proud to say that while he was high none of his patients died? Seriously? He slapped a girl when it wasnt expected at all. He was very regressive. Not only regressive but spoilt, unapoligetoc and obnoxious. One time watch but yet inspite all this i could see the effort made by the makers. GOOD EFFORT... I DIDNT SAY GREAT FILM.

As you said in the later part of this video, \"if you're in relationship and your partner is self derogating then run as fast as possible.\" Don't you think this line defy your Joker analysis, where you appraised\/empathize Joker's mental state and called the movie INCREDIBLE. But in this part you said to run ftom such type of person, if we all keep running from person who're mentally ill then were would our generation will end up. I'm not saying this all because I like Kabir Singh, I'm saying this because I have depression, anxiety and personality disorder. In the movie \"principal\" told the class about his Anger management issue. Kabir also has emotional\/mental issues but I guess you didn't observed him precisely as much as you observed Joker. As per WHO, one in every 20 Indian suffer from depression; 5 out of 100. Hope you understand what I'm trying to say. Peace \u262e\ufe0f"}

Why have we shown selective compassion? Do you really think it is the right time for India to do an activity like NRC given the facts that almost 20% population are below poverty line and 30% of adult population are still illiterate which constitutes more than 50% Women who are still deprived of their basic needs. Do you think, this is the time such exercise would be of any beneficial to India? Don't you think the CJI and GOI has wasted our huge 16K Cr rupees in this unsuccessful exercise and if we live the money aside, look at the extent of trouble and pain people went in Assam due to this. The reason I Pointed to NRC is because NPR is nothing but Opening Step of NRC and with reference to Scroll.in(correct me if I am wrong) the new questions added to NPR are indicators of the NRC exclusion process. You being a Journalist and from Assam, doesn't this pinches your heart and raises alarm. Is there no value of human life on this land anymore? I strongly Oppose NRC, Oppose CAA amendment in the current situation. Was there any effective effort from GOI to stop the infiltration? GOI is just find ways to treat us like goats every now and then. I know, this questions should be thrown at GOI, however, as I see you a so called representative of the GOI most of the time, so, I am throwing this on you. Moreover, whats wrong with you getting stuck in this stupid debates on who told what. Everyone around us promote lies everyday. Nobody really bothers that anymore. Starting from PM to HM to Activist everyone promotes lies everywhere but no facts. So, Arundhati is no different, where we cannot trust the PM\/CJI for that matter, who is Arundhati in that league. No one cares about her. I stopped watching your channel, just thought of looking over today for a change, but nothing changed. Same insensitive arguments and false narratives. I wish I could say alternate narratives, but I see them clearly to be false. Also JFYI, I supported the change in Govt, but really regretting now. I dont support any political party anymore. So, please dont ask me why didn't I speak during UPA rule. I dont have to answer that to you."}

I am surprised beyond anything to see the comments supporting your views and number of followers you have. Below are the points where feminists or a person of any gender with even a bit of a common sense are hurt- 1\\. When the lead actress is never asked if she loves kabir in the movie. According to you, in our culture women are not supposed to be asked? You can just impose whatever you like on her? 2\\. Forcing somebody for intercourse using a knife is a crime in our country, let alone the question of feminism in that scene. And for your kind information, liberals are not only the ones you mentioned. For example, I am pretty sure that you consider Nathuram Godse a hero for killing father of the nation, mahatma gandhi. In such case, you ll as well be considered liberal and so was Nathuram Godse. So don't go on spreading insanity you naive person. Just read more and expand your logical boundaries."}

Father is abusive but Mother keeps quiet and lives by him regardless because she loves him. Actually the love of the women here is far more than the men. In this film the female character she see Gabir beyond his flaw that\u2019s what the film is about. That\u2019s why we need to see love beyond flaws. so Gabir Singh with with all his flawed character there was a women who still liked him. That\u2019s why some people liked it. There were already many films like this already made in Tamil films over the last decade the idea was to appeal the audience with a male dominated character to show how an angry person who lives a gal madly and has changed over the time. The only film that showed this very sensibly was acted by Surya in the film Mohabbat Ke Dushman another film was acted by Vikram in Tamil film called Sethu which was redone in Hindi by Salman Khan in Tere Naam. Gabir Singh is actually a rip off from these Two characters nothing more also the female characters was also rip off from the female characters from these two films who were timid characters. So here you go the director got the idea of writing Arjun Reddy from these two films."}

{"id":504,"label":"NAG","alpha":"a","text":"Homosexuality : is it natural ?[\u56f0] Not to condemn no people, but to reclaim the fallen from this practice, is believing that you can be changed from that stage into a better stage ,to say that we will leave this one off & take the other, who are we to pass that kind of judgment on our brothers & sisters . The Question that should be asked is, where did this perversion of this deviation come about ? Cause when God created this universe & everything in this universe to obey Him & His law , the sun obeys the law under which it is created ,the moon ,the stars , this planet earth obeys the law of its creation. and what we see in the creation is no ,creature deviates from the law under which it is created. The planet moves in its orbit not disobeying the law not even , one fraction of a second & astronomers can bear this witness . i dont care where you find, an ant , a bee , a fowl , a fish. They all obey the nature in which they are created, men is not created to deviate from a certain nature in which he is created. the planet earth is created to incline to the plain of its orbit 23\u00b0c ,30 minutes ,The planet inclines to the plain of its orbit, this is a natural inclination or leaning. Man by nature is inclined towards the female & the female by nature leans towards the man. Now i want to know ,where did this , deviation come from? it was not until a man that was made years ago ,from the original man ,made opposite to the nature of the natural man, made to deviate from the natural way of God & man ,made an opposser of the natural way & deviates from the natural course, His whole life style will be a deviation. The Bible clearly says ,he changed the \"TRUTH\" of God into a lie & when you pervert the truth of God & make it a lie ,than what follows from that is a system of perversion of deviation. we didn't have brothers in Africa walking around with broken wrists . since people were taught and learned of this behavior we can un-learn this behavior. Scripture says \"as a man thinketh so is he \" if you make a man to think like a woman ,We have seen that \"Thought\" is so powerful it projects itself totally on the man's brain & it begins to reshape the material so that a man ,who thinks like a woman , his face, his features, his movements everything about him begins to change according to his thoughts. So scripture says \" behold I the sovereign Lord, make all things new\" so we must get ride of the deviation and bring man back into the natural order in which he is created & the only way to do that is to place in mans brain a new thought & that new thought will bring up a new idea and that new idea will reshape the \"matter\" of the man ,change the form of the man & change the expression of the man. There is no such thing as a homosexual that cannot be changed ,there is no such thing as a \"lesbian\" that cannot be changed, God is here to change us all up ,into a new growth & bring us back to the natural order in which we were created."}

We tried many times very carefully because we are from Brahmin society and we can't break marriage. Then after we gone to many times police action and other things but when we go for these actions they become innocent and after few days they again start doing beating and torture to my sister. One day she told \"Bhaiya if I will stay few more day, I will die because of their torture and painless beat\". Then I have decided to go for police and justice. We have lodged FIR after so many resistance of police. We have almost 10-12 wandered for FIR. In May 2017 finally FIR done. But then police took lot of money from them. Police didn't took single action against them so that they can feel guilty about their did. HOW CAN ANYONE SAY POLICE WILL TAKE ACTION SERIOUSLY? NOW POLICE HAS MORE CHANCE TO DO CURRUPTION. IN INDIA DOWRY IS STATUS. I CAN BET 99.99% OF MARRIAGE CASE BOY WILL NOT MARRIED WITH GIRL WITHOUT DOWRY. BECAUSE DOWRY IS NOT ONLY DOWRY IT'S STATUS QUOE AS WELL."}

Now an opinion depends on different thoughts, situations,beliefs,background,relationships,experiences etc on a very personal level. Difference on every aspect of life is the beautiful essence of the very existence of human being. I, personally agree with many of your thoughts but at the same time dont agree with some opinions. My question is why is it so important to put a tag or lebelize the ones who have different thoughts or dont agree with yours point of view? Why does everybody (who dont share the opinions as yours) have to be a 'feminazi', 'liberal' etc? Dont you think we should be respectful and polite to viewers ( more so because we are all educated and well read people) in a public domain?

I watched the movie today and I don't feel that it's anyway hurting 'the so- called feminist ego'. Instead the entire movie is all about acknowledging the character Kabir's issues, faults mistakes, failures and his unconditional love for Preeti. The culmination of the movie speaks for itself.. wherein a changed Kabir, fully in realisation of his blunders finally meets his love of his life Preeti, who is Not The Victim but the final and true saviour of Kabir. I really don't support the so-called feminism which is now seen hovering in the air. Instead I support true feminism--equality for both the sexes, male as well as female without any kind of discrimination on any ground. Also, negative values are negative for everyone.. Irrespective of men and women."}

And some people are followers of those group who can't speak out like swetabh sir \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 even if they know the truth \ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06"}

{"id":1798,"label":"NAG","alpha":"a","text":"Homosexuality is prohibited in almost every major religion. So we should not follow western culture(even banned in Christianity). Our creator, the Almighty has made our metabolism in such a way that we can only get attracted or do marrige from our opposite sex person. So a big misconception is cleared here that homosexuality comes from our ancestor's genes. Earlier there was a hypothesis by a scientist who said that it may be genetic but later on it was discovered that the scientist himself was a gay(psychologically not genetically). When people break the laws of nature(like having sex with multiple persons of their opposite sex) their mind later gets diverted to people of their own gender(like in western countries earlier, there were so called mistresses 10 or 15 for a single man) who fulfill the needs of wives for him alone. So, its our fault that we had multiple relationships which made us psychologically so ill that we started getting intrest in our own gender people also. God never made us like this nor he will. We are breaking the rules of nature. It is also scientically proven that having a single partner and enjoying a sex life with him\/her throughout your life rather than being a playboy or playgirl(sorry for the words) make us a better human being in terms of both gender and obeying God's commandments. So homosexuality is a sin in almost every religion and we should not legal it in India. We should teach our future generations to have respect for their opposite gender person(especially to boys) so that they do not develop a mindset that girls are made for having fun(this will harm that boy psychologically later), he may start finding intrest in his male friends just to complete his fantasies. Same apply for girls. We should get bounded to the rules made by nature and find a single life partner for us whom we can persue our sexual and spiritual life. At last I would complete my stand by saying that God says us to follow the Truth rather than to follow people who speak that homosexuality should be legal in India on behalf of their democracy. Nothing is bigger than the Nature given laws and the Truth of life. Peace \u270c"}

{"id":2329,"label":"NAG","alpha":"a","text":"Totally agreed with your practicality but there are many subtle things that actually shows how bad the character is and how he suffers for that. You actually said a lot of things wrong: 1\\. He understands how wrong his attitude is 2\\. Looses his license even though he could have lied and won the case; this shows how the character matures and starts to remorse his attitude 3\\. He is a kind of person who runs away from a complex situation but at the end he never wanted to bring that as an excuse (had it not been his friend, girl would have never known). He did wrong and he realised. 4\\. Totally wrong when you say he is abusing his parents. The ending parts shows how his relation with father changed. 5\\. Totally wrong when you say he used to stalk that girl even after breakup. He never does that even though he is unable to move on 6\\. If u see the movie you will understand how he started hating himself. A man who is narcissistic by nature when he starts to be ashamed of his personality and attitude, its a very big positive change. 7\\. Okay i agree he ends up getting the girl in a very unrealistic way, but the scene where he is ready to accept the baby and give him a father without anything spoken shows the purity in his love (i agree the ripening of the relationship was very bollywood typical though) 8\\. yes agreed that he was self harming but nowhere did he let the girl know about it and hence force her to take any decisions based on that. The person is fake masculine i agree but not manipulative so you cant call it abusive relationship. 9\\. This guy cares so much about the girl that he rubs her shoulder after removing her heavy bag. 10\\. The girl had equal domination rights in him as well. She slaps him when he was out of control angry in a public place and he starts to apologise. I am sorry I do see a trait of matured and very mentally intimate relationship here. 11\\. I agree his background was typical bollywood but again as you mentioned if he was not so pampered he would not have done all the blunders (a humble background would end up seeing him in jail and maybe a underworld don biography can be written after that), so to give the film all the colours he had to belong to a family of means. How about 50 shades of grey as an example ! 12\\. Apparently he never reads(according to you) but how about the fact that he took her and taught her a lot during a song and never tried to take advantage of her (she made the first move which shows her agreement). Its also shown even though he tries to be masculine he never really could face the girl for long, he was not comfident till the girl agreed. 13\\. You need to agree that girl enjoyed the character and hence he could be what is portrayed. And hence like kabir (which i do consider a realistic flawed person), preeti is also a very real character, silent but manipulative. 14\\. Regarding that sex scene. Thats a typical example of rape. Many rapist actually raped when they were mentally unstabled adding physical needs (hormones) on top of that. But he says he is sorry and leaves (he dis wrong but he realises, isnt that good? Isnt that what a normal person should do?) 15\\. He is tharki? Yes he is ... its his sadness mixed with hormones, a very typical situation of being desparate. But that same person never wanted to go into a fake relationship, isnt that honesty and maturity? He never wanted to hurt anyones feelings like his were hurt. All he wants is sex! Isnt that what hookup culture is in modern Metros? People hookup even without any mental desparation, just for fun. Why is that not a very real situation then? Please feel free to couter attack me with a debate. But till then your reviews are as flawed and biased as the charecter of kabir. Ps. I am a big fan of ur work and not a narcissist sympathizer. Dont worry man todays youth gets enough dose of dumb sexual contents. They are gullable. And sex sells, thats truth, hence is sold by bollywood. Kabir singh dint sell dumb sex atlst and is a masterpiece for acting skills. Maybe watch Vijaya dervakonda in arjun reddy. Takes a lot of effort to get in the shoes of those villain charecters, should appreciate that before calling it garbage. Ranvir was great actor since his charecter lost in padmavati but shahid is shit because his charecter finally gets love? Totally hypocrisy"}

When a kid in his teens sees one of these so called \"romantic bollywood films\", it is bound to play with his mind. In this scenario, i certainly won't blame the directors or producers, because I'm sure they may have great scripts, but the audience in India is such that they dont want to see that. They don't support it, they dont like it. They want to see that typical \"mirchi masala\" movie and they dont want to think beyond that. In such a situation, the cinema industry has no option but to comply with them. I think its high time we open up our narrow thinking. I saw Joker yesterday, and oh boy was that a masterpiece. I find it hard to believe that we dont have such brilliant ideas, but bringing it to the big screens is the biggest problem. I can do nothing but hope that one day, bollywood moves on and gives a chance to better projects. Kudos!"}

Preeti character like character can be seen in Hollywood movie eg bella from twilight Anastasia from fifty shades of grey. These woman dont have standing character they often under the influence pf their male partners. Such girls do exist. Kabir singh movie became controversial in north only the audience in south had no problems with the movie. There are lot of movies released with more sexual assaults and violance than kabir singh then why everyone is after kabir singh. Movies don't encourage violence their are lot of violence happen in real world. Flim is a media that represents to the audience that this type of violence do occur.

{"id":2814,"label":"NAG","alpha":"a","text":"What people don't realize is that if Kabir Singh made you feel uncomfortable, it was supposed to. It did exactly what it set out to do. With Arjun Reddy and now Kabir Singh, the director Sandeep Vanga is only exhibiting a different kind of genre by narrating the story from the perspective of a protagonist who's grossly flawed. For once we are shown the film through the prism of grey rather than the extremes of black or white. Because the story unfolds from his perspective, Kabir thinks he's the right kind of man, always in the right, wronged by circumstances and justifies his alcohol and substance abuse on the same basis, which is typical of any addict. Throughout the duration of the movie, he doesn't realize the fact that the fault lies solely with him. That it's his nature that's rotten, not his destiny. Throughout the film, we are shown his downward spiral into insanity, almost feeling a sense of suffocating hopelessness as though we too are infected by his self-inflicted agony. Vijay\/Shahid both did a great job in conveying this torment in their respective renditions of the character. This misery continues till the very end, up to the point where we as an audience have given up any kind of hope of redemption for the protagonist, when he does a 360 degree turn by finally acknowledging his problem and sets out to seek salvation. I didn't find anything remotely wrong about this movie. The film doesn't in any way glorify the character. On the contrary it makes you feel disgusted and repulsed by him to the extent that you'd never even think of following his lifestyle. You'd completely abhor it. Personally, speaking from experience, as a person who's never had alcohol or consumed drugs or been a domineering misogynist for that matter, the film rather than giving me a wrong message instead made me all the more determined not to stray on to such a path. You literally end up begging the character to mend his ways. The supporting characters in the movie like Kabir's brother and his friends are all the while trying to draw him out of his ruination but to no avail. This film is in fact a very revolutionary step in Indian cinema, depicting a story about a flawed man, languishing in a greyish-dark space rather than lily-white or pitch- black. Usually our films don't go into that area. The film actually delivers a positive message that you can start redeeming yourself even when you touch the rock bottom of hell as long as you possess the will to do so. When Kabir is at his lowest point after being debarred from his profession and having suffered a personal tragedy, he is at the rock bottom of his pit and he has to make the choice whether he wants to remain confined to the darkness of the pit for eternity in a limbo or start climbing out of it. He does the latter and thus the film after subjecting us to a lot of darkness and discomfiture for most of its runtime leaves us with the teensiest glimmer of hope. Just like life. For all those who were unsettled and disturbed by the movie, as I said earlier, it was supposed to make you feel so. The superlative acting and technical expertise made the movie a worthwhile experience. I wish all these ultra-feminists and so-called liberals watch this movie with an open mind and learn to accept a posture distinct from their own. Especially since this breed cries hoarse when accusing the right wing of trying to distort history and current narratives to impose their points of view, when they are themselves intolerant to those of others. To deny that people like Arjun Reddy\/Kabir Singh exist, would be denying the harsh reality of society. These are the same people who whoop and clap when Swara Bhaskar masturbates and abuses her husband on screen."}

{"id":2901,"label":"OAG","alpha":"a","text":"Dear Pratik, Not all feminists and liberals go to extreme measures like putting down men and humanising terrorists and what not. The cultural values you keep referring to are ruining women's and even men's lives in the whole world and especially in India. Need i mention dowry, domestic violence, rapes, false rape accusations, lgbtq rights, mard ko dard nahi hota crap? You just bashed two communities because of the behaviour of some of its members which is exactly what you accused them to do. You are a hypocrite. You are influencing a huge amount of people what you just did was spread hatred. Did you know feminist actually means the equality of the sexes not manhating as you said? As for the review if you call slapping each other, bashing your partner's family, not being able to confront you dad about forcing you into marriage with another guy after becoming an independent woman(a doctor!) , forcing a girl on knife point to show her body, drugs, smoking and drinking excessively because you cannot deal with a breakup, performing surgury while intoxicated a heroic romance then god bless you. God save you. Sincerely, A feminist"}

Who stays confused in his life? I think you have not seen the movie till the last minute..Kabir Singh who was rude from the first he also cries at a time when everything was going out of his hand..so it shows hero gained some lesson from his past and audience should take this as lesson from the movie.

I don't say dark character should not be shown in movies but showing its consequences is necessary too... The problem with kabir singh is not with the negativity of the character, but with the people buying into the negativity. People are proclaiming him the HERO and is glorifying him as an inspiration! Kabir treated Peeeti as his Toy, his 'Bandi'. Kabir at no point asks preeti for her consent regarding his forcing her to be into relationship with him, which can mislead many men too, even lots of girls will find it cute too.. Imagine a Kabir Singh in your Life!!! My Problem is not with the movie or character but the character is so real that it can lead to birth of so many Kabir Singh in real life which is regressive to the society.. The character is celebrated as a romantic lead which is dangerous if subjected to real life, people are finding his actions , his abuse, hus anger cool.. his negativity is celebrated but thats really wrong.. his character is so real that it can provoke men in our country... Kabir Singh is a masterpiece, Acting is Fabulous, but In reality I don't support such person, but today's youth especially boys will consider this cool & heroic which is a threat..

Kabir singh is threatening everybody that preeti is my lady, nobody should come close to her and thats a morally right thing acc. to you. Wow, what hypocrisy. I know the movie is about negative side of kabir singh but unfortunately this side of kabir singh has been highlighted in a very stylished misogynistic way. In this film one thing is clearly shown that women should like and look for dominating and possessive lovers. If same role will be based on a women then u will obviously have problems, you will see it as a unculturable and non traditional thing. Why women should always be shown in submissive roles. 99% of movies in india are based on male point of view but if 1% of movies are based on female point of view, their liberties, why everybody has problem in that.

{"id":3241,"label":"NAG","alpha":"a","text":"Bro you should watch that movie again just to clear some facts. When Kabir meets Preeti in the end, she tells her about her residence in some hostel and she worked in a clinic. Movies are not always meant to connect them with reality and teach us lessons ( I admit some movies do that). Some are meant to enjoy. The movie shows an excellent chemistry between two guys with some mind blowing romantic songs, how much more do you expect from it bro? Nothing is perfect bro. As you said person should ideally move on immediately after break up (in one of the videos you said in a slang way that, \u201ckhat khat move on karna chahiye mard ko\"), I am with you bro. But it would take 3-4 months for a guy and it\u2019s normal. Kabir Singh here takes his time say 7-8months (not too much for even a fictional story), and then they marry. He developed smoking and drinking habit but even in that time he worked. Yeah one thing you exaggerated about medical students (they didn\u2019t get time of all this). I being a medico can say that we get time for our relationships and we also live as a social animal. (I am not proving you wrong but you just exaggerated the fact)."}

He didn't not want to escape like a coward. And lastly he knew that he is wrong. He knew that, this is a phase in his Life.

Nowhere did the director tried to justify Kabir Singh or tried to portray him as a great human being. It's the story of a flawed character, his downfall to the path of self destruction and final redemption. Actually for me it's quite an inspiring story. We all have inner flaws and demons within us and are constantly fighting with them. Kabir Singh became a victim of his inner demons which led to his downfall. But its inspiring to see his final redemption after controlling all his inner demons. So I request all feminists to have some basic knowledge about films before trying to criticize. They should watch the Oscar Winning film of Robert de Niro 'Raging Bull' before judging Kabir Singh. As usual a fantastic video by you Pratik ji and by your sound reasoning u have given a tight slap on the face of all these feminists."}

{"id":3655,"label":"CAG","alpha":"a","text":"The contemporary feminist lives such a comfortable life that she has the time to complain about such trivial nonsense like manspreading and movie characters being a little too masculine. And if she wanted to, she would make a video about the movie, degrade it to the point that people would stop watching it not caring about the hard work the creators put for it and a female host of her channel would laugh about it and so would their audience. But I\u2019m the one who is sexist if I complain about it because according to feminist theory, I\u2019m privileged and the power structure gives advantages to men. What advantages? They can\u2019t say. And because of this power structure, sexism towards men doesn\u2019t exist. According to feminism, I am so privileged that I don\u2019t even have the right to talk about gender issues. All of my opinions are automatically invalid because I\u2019m a man. I am a man \u2013 I am evil, I am disposable, I am privileged. The thing is, I actually do care about gender equality. I would gladly point out real sexism when I see it being done against women, something which the new wave feminists bafflingly neglect to do when it\u2019s being perpetuated by anyone. But feminists don\u2019t return the favour. Their narrative is that I am the cause of all the world\u2019s problems and I have to be the one to change, to make sacrifices and give more and more to them because of this imaginary bogeyman called the \u201cPatriarchy\u201d which they claim gives me all the systemic advantages in society. The concept of a patriarchy is essential to their ideology and this core makes the ideology paint me as the oppressor and the villain and I\u2019m sick of it. I\u2019m not a catcaller, I\u2019m not a wife beater, and I\u2019m not a rapist. But I\u2019m held accountable for the actions of the few men who do these things and that\u2019s bullshit. And it\u2019s exactly the type of bullshit being perpetuated by several social media sites and YouTube channels - the idea that men are the problem, that we should be ashamed of what we are and that masculinity is toxic and needs to be stamped out. Feminist may claim that they don\u2019t hate men but actions speak louder than words. If you call yourself a feminist but if you agree that all of the things that I talked about are wrong, then you need to stop calling yourself a feminist. You don\u2019t need to call yourself a feminist to be an advocate for equality. Feminism doesn\u2019t hold a monopoly on that as much as they like to think they do. And if you truly value equality, you will drop the feminist label and stop trying to defend it because it is \u2013 destructive, divisive, counter-intuitive, and predicated on lies and misinformation. Feminism is bullshit and it is unworthy of respect."}

Because people were all out making arjun reddy\/kabir singh as hero and overlooking the self-destructive habits he had, in a way validating them. But the way you have tried to explain it, i want every viewer to take a note of this. That kabir singh is an imperfect human and we should realize every bad habit of his as bad and good traits of him should be appreciated too. Considering him so great, publicising him as a macho dude is in a way whitewashing every wrong thing in him and due to this i was very uncomfirtable. I cant see the youth taking inspiration from this and getting into drinking or drugs. There was no liberal or feminist agenda behind it. So not everthing is about liberalism or feminism."}

But critically speaking, this movie is solely based on an individual's story. The name itself is Kabir Singh. Secondly, we have seen such rowdy and complicated female characters in Hindi Movies, just like Tannu's character. Now without taking any sides, I would like to state that movies should be watched critically, and should never have emotional connection if we want to review. And I agree with your review and your explanation of the movie. This time I honestly watched the movie before watching any reviews. And it's a good movie with good character development. Good story line. And it's a story of an individual. This movie is solely meant for commercial success. And I am also not happy about the over critical feminist reviews.

There are many things wrong with this movie like kabir Singh marks preeti as his territory without asking her, are we all guys not taught to ask girls out properly. There are many guys who think it's okay to act this way, because preeti did not have a problem. But what if a girl says no, guys will take on their ego and harass a girl till she says Yes. I have sisters who faced this. This sends out a very wrong message, and guys learn it indirectly. That's why everyone is fighting for it. There are a lot of things wrong with other movies too, but Lets not take that and defend this movie. Lets pinpoint stuff if anything is wrong to get better content which can be entertaining."}

{"id":4260,"label":"CAG","alpha":"a","text":"People may criticize Pratik Borade by saying that he takes movies too seriously and always talks about ideologies instead of focusing on technical aspects. But ideology IS the most important thing. People in India are influenced by movies more than anything else. So if a movie is trying to promote negativity in society subliminally or openly it needs to be called out and criticised openly. Some will say \"Oh it is just a film.\" But many people DO take these movies seriously and it does affect as well as change their lives. So though I disagree with Pratik regarding some movies, I hugely respect what he does. Filmmakers should not be allowed to create whatever bullshit they want to manipulate minds of youths, simply in the name of artistic freedom!"}
