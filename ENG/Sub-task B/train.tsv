2	NGEN	a	🤣🤣😂😂🤣🤣🤣😂osm vedio ....keep it up...make more vedios like this
3	NGEN	a	What the fuck was this? I respect shwetabh and i have been watching his videos for quite a long time but this review was shit. Nobody wants to watch the movie for reality or blah. You dont watch movies for inspiration you would rather read books and biographies. Yes its true that some people are getting influenced and doing all shitty fuckery but just think. Anyone who takes this movie seriouslyis already a chutiya. And you dont go to theatre in india for some reality shit and if u really seek reality and logical scripts and characters without plotholes and all then you wouldnt be watching kabir singh. So I think you just made this for views, cause theres no need for this so called raw review. And one thing you acted like u forgot the movie name like seriously you know the whole story and you pronounced this overhyped mess wrongly? Oh common!!!😂
4	NGEN	a	Concerned authorities should bring arundathi Roy and other these type of people before the law of the land.for giving anti national statements
5	NGEN	a	It seems like these people want to be famous nothing more they don't care if people die by their hateful talks.
6	NGEN	a	Best topic for Law Students !
7	NGEN	a	Even when kabir singh was unaware that Preeti is having his son he was ready to accept other's baby and was ready to give his name though that was his baby but still he was ready to accept preeti even after thinking she has sex with other guy and feminists would not see this.
8	NGEN	a	She is wrong .

14	NGEN	a	@Dushant Sain EXACTLY!!!!! don't we just go to see a movie to comprehend what the director and the story telling has to offer.... it's about understanding the Movie not Making all the things shown in the movie to the heart.

23	NGEN	a	Saurabh Dwivedi sir, i appreciate you for maintaining neutral view of point. As for now, we have two media one modi loving and 2nd is modi hating. But you are neutral
24	GEN	a	Why can't the Indian government take serious actions to those who talk against the nation or anyone who involved in instigating any sort of violence or disturbing the peace of the nation. Freedom of speech doesn't allow anyone to go anti-national. This bitch (Arundhati Roy) has already given such statements that are anti-national on numerous occasions but she is still living freely. It's high time for the government to pass a law against these bastards, it doesn't matter who you are.
25	NGEN	a	Exactly. That was 100000000000x better than shitty kabir singh.

32	NGEN	a	I literally cannot imagine a scenario where I'd be watching content from this channel, leave alone penning down a comment. I personally abhor this propaganda infused right-wing program and have reported it multiple times. It's in the best interest of the nation if it ceases to exist from the digital platforms and is confined to television only. Nevertheless, needed to get certain thoughts off of my chest so here goes: 1\. Stop broadcasting these staged debates that resemble poorly produced b-grade flicks at best. The background score during the intro, the participants who are more like the bickering neighborhood aunties than dignified panelists, etc. stink of sub-standard nonsense. Stop fooling the public. 2\. Instead of all this nonsense, why the hell can't you show how the PM and Home Minister have successfully confused the nation and are literally behaving like clueless self-contradicting juveniles? 3\. With a few days left for 2020, our nation is yet to overcome the confines of religion. I had high hopes for my country and had started believing that we would achieve great heights in the field of Science and Technology that would put us in the big leagues, but no, we are all weighed down by this archaic concept (read religion) and have ensured that progress is a goal that is quite far from our reaches. A note to Republic TV: Instead of showing all this nonsense about anti-nationals, lutyens and what not please focus on key items that are deterring our nation (unemployment, poor economy,etc.). The mass does not care about the sub-standard reporting you do on these ridiculous theories. They want some concrete information that the news channels alone can provide.
33	NGEN	a	I was waiting for it.... Very honest opinion

42	NGEN	a	By the way i myself being a 21st century modern girl, i did not watch four more shots as i found the trailer and the interviews of the cast very disturbing. Feminism is losing it’s real agenda i.e equality of gender, but becoming an advocate of all sort of sexual shit. Feminism is much more than sexual freedom, i request all my fellow girls to not get carried away by such ideas.
43	NGEN	a	Ranu is a bad girl 👍👍😸😆😂
44	NGEN	a	Looks like a ghost, real conjuring
45	NGEN	a	The world needs more men like you
46	NGEN	a	**Correct**
47	NGEN	a	@Pratik Borade just saw 2 mins of the video you recommend and seems like you write your own dictionary. Sorry but I would be following other dictionaries like Cambridge and merriam webster.
48	NGEN	a	The whole Bollywood premise is showing a life people dream about and not realism. It's a form of escapism from reality.

64	NGEN	a	Totally agree with ur points bro nd kabir singh haters must have girts to counter these points if they can't then they must shut their fuckin mouths rather than vomiting diarrhoea against d movie.....if they doesn't want to watch d movie then who is forcing them.......
65	NGEN	a	All of you r jealous of Ranu Mondal. .you have no education. .bt we support Ranu ji fr her talent ...we never interfare her personal issues. .we love her devine voice. .dats it..
66	NGEN	a	hi pratik, hope you are doing well. Call it a coincidence or anything, I came across a designer liberal page criticising Kabir Singh for MISOGYNY. Frankly speaking I have seen only Arjun Reddy, and I was unable to find single trace of misogyny anywhere. If these people were so concerned about women, there will call out real tharkis in our country. But anyway they like Veere Di Wedding and 4 More shots please. So better neglect them and let them whine like babies. Loved the couple Arjun and Deepthi, Kabir and Priti👩‍❤️‍👨👩‍❤️‍👨. Movie is top class. Keep up the good work 🙏😇

125	NGEN	a	This movie is really great
126	NGEN	a	I saw arjun reddy.... i am not a liberal or a feminist but it is my opinion I saw arjun reddy yesterday on amazon and for one i had to pause whenever character speak bcoz d subtitles were too fast i didnt have time to read the whole thing. Secondly i didnt like arjun ka character- womZaniser, drug addict, alcoholic.and very abusive. Thirdly, by saying i like thia girl in particular clothing and then going from class to class plus the girl's hostel and giving it the name of love isn't love at all and it's CREEPY like srk chasing after kajol in DDLJ. Fourth point, after repeated pleas by his parents, he still drinks and smokes. He was shown in a negative light....but atleast there was a courtroom scene. And he is proud to say that while he was high none of his patients died? Seriously? He slapped a girl when it wasnt expected at all. He was very regressive. Not only regressive but spoilt, unapoligetoc and obnoxious. One time watch but yet inspite all this i could see the effort made by the makers. GOOD EFFORT... I DIDNT SAY GREAT FILM. THERE WASNT ANYTHING GREAT ABOUT THE FILM. ARJUN REDDY WAS as my teacher would say A SPINELESS JELLYFISH.
127	NGEN	a	Bro, Nice video

133	NGEN	a	"All the libtard reviews are like... ""No woman should watch the movie"" ""No one should like the movie"" ""If anyone likes the movie they are a terrible person"" 🤦 Even if they are not outrightly saying those statements that is exactly what they are implying... They don't care about the 10s of thousands of women who come out of the theaters saying they loved the movie...🤷 Because they are wrong and only the liberal feminist point of view is the absolute truth...🤮"

152	NGEN	a	There is no action taken against woman, who file false 498a cases, so crime is the only option left for a sensible Men like him, who was looking for justice...
153	GEN	a	Bad boy character is more preferable then good character in girls eye...that's why destructive films popular...
154	NGEN	a	Well I do agree with most of the points you said..but I just feel that the initial things done by Kabir in order to approach Priti were kind of scary. Normally any girl would get scared. Priti's reaction to all of that was kind of weird to me.
155	NGEN	a	Watch Section 375. It's a masterpiece exposing feminism.

U r very much right to point out the hypocrisy of the liberals and so called feminists.Actually they themselves r confused of what they want in life and as a result of this they live a lonely life at the end of the day. They don't want to understand relationship. Their feminism starts with the f... word and ends in the f...... word.
169	NGEN	a	nice bhai

I totally understand that you have a lot of hatred for liberals n feminists which is justified coz of what a lot of them have been propogating but not every idea of feminism is wrong pratik. Bollywood has a history of showing these things ""cool"", that is my only problem with these characters. I am all game for negative characters but I don't like them being glorified, making them look cool. I won't even start with 4 shots, I didn't even like alia's aggresion in gully boy so it's not one sided. As much as I enjoy your views on nationalism, our history , I didn't feel comfortable watching this. 🙏"
198	NGEN	a	Yes, u r right man
199	NGEN	a	Kabir Singh best love story ever 😘😘
200	NGEN	a	"As a lesbian, I wouldn't say it'll ""completely"" contribute to reduction in population. They need to legalize 2 children policy like China did. Also, all couples should adopt at least 1 orphan instead of trying to reproduce. Only 25% of orphans are being adopted and others will be 18 then kicked out. They'll become homeless. Rural areas should stop reproducing lots of children."

229	NGEN	a	@NIRMALYA SASMAL just tell me one thing have u watched the whole speach it's just 4-5 min u should watch it.
230	NGEN	a	"I agree with you but I have a point too. Before elaborating my point, I want to let you know that I'm here after seeing the ""Joker Movie analysis"". I firmly believe the male character in Kabir Singh was irresponsible and doesn't have any reflection with real life or practicality. As you said in the later part of this video, ""if you're in relationship and your partner is self derogating then run as fast as possible."" Don't you think this line defy your Joker analysis, where you appraised/empathize Joker's mental state and called the movie INCREDIBLE. But in this part you said to run ftom such type of person, if we all keep running from person who're mentally ill then were would our generation will end up. I'm not saying this all because I like Kabir Singh, I'm saying this because I have depression, anxiety and personality disorder. In the movie ""principal"" told the class about his Anger management issue. Kabir also has emotional/mental issues but I guess you didn't observed him precisely as much as you observed Joker. As per WHO, one in every 20 Indian suffer from depression; 5 out of 100. Hope you understand what I'm trying to say. Peace ☮️"

268	NGEN	a	@Arnab: Do you know what are the plans of Govt with the Illegal immigrants? How would a refugee prove religious persecution? Why have we shown selective compassion? Do you really think it is the right time for India to do an activity like NRC given the facts that almost 20% population are below poverty line and 30% of adult population are still illiterate which constitutes more than 50% Women who are still deprived of their basic needs. Do you think, this is the time such exercise would be of any beneficial to India? Don't you think the CJI and GOI has wasted our huge 16K Cr rupees in this unsuccessful exercise and if we live the money aside, look at the extent of trouble and pain people went in Assam due to this. The reason I Pointed to NRC is because NPR is nothing but Opening Step of NRC and with reference to Scroll.in(correct me if I am wrong) the new questions added to NPR are indicators of the NRC exclusion process. You being a Journalist and from Assam, doesn't this pinches your heart and raises alarm. Is there no value of human life on this land anymore? I strongly Oppose NRC, Oppose CAA amendment in the current situation. Was there any effective effort from GOI to stop the infiltration? GOI is just find ways to treat us like goats every now and then. I know, this questions should be thrown at GOI, however, as I see you a so called representative of the GOI most of the time, so, I am throwing this on you. Moreover, whats wrong with you getting stuck in this stupid debates on who told what. Everyone around us promote lies everyday. Nobody really bothers that anymore. Starting from PM to HM to Activist everyone promotes lies everywhere but no facts. So, Arundhati is no different, where we cannot trust the PM/CJI for that matter, who is Arundhati in that league. No one cares about her. I stopped watching your channel, just thought of looking over today for a change, but nothing changed. Same insensitive arguments and false narratives. I wish I could say alternate narratives, but I see them clearly to be false. Also JFYI, I supported the change in Govt, but really regretting now. I dont support any political party anymore. So, please dont ask me why didn't I speak during UPA rule. I dont have to answer that to you.

301	NGEN	a	Alpha male is a pack builder not a timid destroyer who hides behind the mask of masculinity... Yes only dumb girls who has extreme psychological issues themselves can fall in love with such a gross character !!! Codependencey is a thing ... Kabir shing is a portrayal of toxic codependency only !!! A sane independent girl will run miles away as soon as she smells a Kabir shing ... But if she doesn't and embresses the insane dominant dynamic then mere Bhai you both have deep rooted psychological issues and need immediate therapy ... Otherwise together or not both are doomed my friend !! In my opinion if you even like the character you need therapy ... Ask yourself what within you makes you like and imitate such a gross tatty character!! Very very problematic
302	NGEN	a	I. like you very nice

333	NGEN	a	RX100 MOVIE REVIEW
334	NGEN	a	As ultimate GPS
335	NGEN	a	He is hero for all those who is suffering from false claim charged by women to their husband and their in law. Show this case to government than they will realised that the law they made for justice is leading toward blood & violence.
336	NGEN	a	You have gone beyond limits this time Pratik. You should not talk about feminism and liberalism when you have no idea of what it is! I am surprised beyond anything to see the comments supporting your views and number of followers you have. Below are the points where feminists or a person of any gender with even a bit of a common sense are hurt- 1\. When the lead actress is never asked if she loves kabir in the movie. According to you, in our culture women are not supposed to be asked? You can just impose whatever you like on her? 2\. Forcing somebody for intercourse using a knife is a crime in our country, let alone the question of feminism in that scene. And for your kind information, liberals are not only the ones you mentioned. For example, I am pretty sure that you consider Nathuram Godse a hero for killing father of the nation, mahatma gandhi. In such case, you ll as well be considered liberal and so was Nathuram Godse. So don't go on spreading insanity you naive person. Just read more and expand your logical boundaries.
337	NGEN	a	The basic ideology behind Liberals and Feminists is not wrong but a lot of the people who consider themselves representatives of these ideas are in wrong. Everyone always remembers that
338	NGEN	a	Kabir Singh my favourite 🔼🔼
339	GEN	a	He should have also killed that bitch
340	GEN	a	What a vacuum minded witch, product of May be so called Ranga-Billa. Such mean people gets Bookers Award, Disgusting!
341	NGEN	a	10 inch mouth haaaaa
342	NGEN	a	Am also lesbian... Who is single.... I want a girlfriend soo much....
343	NGEN	a	I agree with this girl's comment if God does not punish them then who are you people pandits and molvi sahab's do it secretly and padri sahabs does it inside churches world wide hahaha hypocrites
344	NGEN	a	Please give a spoiler talk on Dark Knight do you watch The Dark Knight and you also like Heath Ledger as acting as Joker
345	NGEN	a	Madam Arundhati Roy go to Kapil Sharma show, insensible incompetence politics .
346	NGEN	a	+MR Romantic Pawan ok

358	NGEN	a	Sir plz like my comment
359	NGEN	a	Super boss😎😎
360	NGEN	a	It would be great if you could regularly share some books/movies/short films that are constructive in nature, some or other ways of entertainment. I remember you starting a book club, 'Homo Sapiens' was the book, we need some more initiatives like that. Much love, support and respect like always!
361	NGEN	a	best of luck 2018
362	NGEN	a	Take notes from fight club , Tyler durden is the badass and coolest character Ever , but the writer only says he is the negative character and not a character to take inspiration from but in Kabir Singh things end up in favour of him , telling be like Kabir Singh it's nothing wrong
363	NGEN	a	Arundhati Roy is a disgrace to India.It's sad.
364	NGEN	a	Shwetabh, i would really like to hear your thoughts on joker. It will be really great if you come up with that.
365	NGEN	a	As doctor,i realized to work on my physique and stay fit,thats what i got from it,rest is bullshit
366	NGEN	a	So basically kabir singh is tere naam' s radhe on drugs
367	NGEN	a	Wonderful videoooo I like it
368	GEN	a	Who the fuck told that stupid asshole that LGBT is not our culture??????????? It was always our culture! Go read the VEDAS! IT didn't come from outside of India. It was Just banned by a Jerk of King in Britain in some 15th century and the only thing happened in western culture was that they removed the law and accepted it earlier than us, who here are not even ready to talk about the topic!! They first brought the law and they first removed the law! But the people in our country don't even know what's our culture! BC MC SAALE!!!!!!!!!!!!
369	NGEN	a	Love metal 🤘
370	NGEN	a	I just hate this movie though I have no hatred or doubt about Shahid acting . He really nailed his role . But this kind of movie is not made for India. Bollywood is producing nothing just crap movies with a small pinch of 'love' . They need to grow up . Even Indians need to grow up too.
371	NGEN	a	A medico here ! 10 hours daily study is must to pass annual exams in MBBS atleast .

379	NGEN	a	Yeah...
380	NGEN	a	"If you still think Bollywood is GARBAGE then see the trailer called ""ADVENTURES OF SRIMANARAYANA"""
381	NGEN	a	I agree with a lot of what you said. But a lot of things didnt make any sense, like the way the love develops felt artificial and forced, and not organically. Really not about feminism or misogynist, the movie as such didnt make much sense.
382	NGEN	a	Finally someone said it! Thank you mensutra for this video👍👏👏👏
383	NGEN	a	How about joker!??? Please review it😇
384	NGEN	a	Exactly! I completely agree

390	NGEN	a	'toxic' is the new 'sexy' 💪
391	NGEN	a	Share dis to evryone..
392	GEN	a	no one is homosexual by birth, their is no scientific or genetic proof. :) it arises when people get tired of the natural process. And this is basically because of the arising pornography and vulgarity that is openly viewed and displayed and majority are prone to it so when they grow tired of the nature, they tend to find pleasure in something that goes against nature. So we need to support good and decent content on media and promote early marriages to abstain from this taboo. And ofcourse this homosexuality is a sign of the day of judgement as we Muslims believe so we need to seek forgiveness and thank Allah for His blessings. [#freedomofspeech](http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23freedomofspeech) :) good day
393	NGEN	a	By filling our lungs with smoke and then dying to cancer? You mean that's how men should be

395	NGEN	a	true review about film and fake librals too.. prateek sir.keep it up the same honesty.
396	NGEN	a	I read a blog post of India Today they were trying to defame the film by giving bad reviews. They even called Arjun Reddy B grade film.. That's really disgusting..

399	NGEN	a	@Ritwik Sinha perfect 😂
400	GEN	a	All most all movies promote feminazism. Even in English movies. Movies have become indoctrination tools to hypnotize masses to become slave to women. These are unhealthy and destructive addiction
401	GEN	a	flawia egnis is a bitch
402	GEN	a	Arundati Roy is pagal kutia.
403	NGEN	a	I love films like kabir singh. Why? It reduces the competition. After watching KS many teenagers and also adults started following him. They just destroyed their next 3-4 years. Competition over.
404	NGEN	a	Epic🔥😂
405	NGEN	a	Absolutely right.
406	NGEN	a	Agree with u
407	NGEN	a	Well said bro ! Keep it up
408	NGEN	a	Please don't put gay people in bad light. Even i am gay and i am proud of myself but that doesn't mean that i will kill others for the sake of my happiness.
409	GEN	a	Sucharita you are ugly but atleast don't bark ugly about some good movie
410	NGEN	a	Hit like if you want shwetabh Bhai to give review of all major Bollywood movies releasing so as to give youths a right direction
411	GEN	a	Stop being straight. Yes that is how stupid you sound
412	GEN	a	Army chief is correct and gays should never be allowed in arm forces. Itna hi Sauk he to sare chakke ghar pe pubg khelo.
413	NGEN	a	As long as India entertains Bangladesh we will have such problems. The names of the accused shows how one religion that wants to impose their teachings on the society, itself is corrupted. This case really shook me. WB administration also did not support the common man, whether it was madhyamgram, kamduni or park street case. I m ashamed
414	NGEN	a	U said true bro This talk is to. Most of the fanpages on social media
415	NGEN	a	The country, where intellectuals like Arundhati Roy are not respected , it is bound to be degrade...She is far intelligent than these hired criminal journalist... I will slap out those who will come to my house regarding NPR. They have already adhaar card and NSSO organisation for carrying out social survey. Actually NPR is a sin in the garb of showing it as a some kind of social survey...BJP decline has started and soon we will witness it's free fall
416	GEN	a	3 case can happen, (a) if gay is that high rank officers then new people can be forcely asked for sex for promotion, leave , transfer , financial or other benefit, (2) if everybody know that someone is gay , their group will discriminate him or normal friend of him can be seen the same way, and other group will make fun of that group. Indians are not so mature enough to deal with that situation are generally countryside people join defennce that is ugly truth. (C) gAy couple will have emotional attachment and will never take harsh step in critical condition, they will not have same aggression they will become defensive they will be interested in long living with their partners.
417	NGEN	a	Feminism is socioeconomic equality... No one should rape anyone. How bizzare is that. Feminism is about having equal opportunity and responsibility
418	NGEN	a	Correct i am fully agree with you
419	NGEN	a	So saddd... Today I'm clear about this case ...... Tq director of police file for make this episode
420	NGEN	a	Thank you for making this video brother I was waiting for this review .I didnot watch this movie but i saw few review on youtube where as you said they are juding the kabir singh character .At one point i even agreed at few points bcz in the songs two scenes i too dislike yes i agree but after watching your video now i understood and out of this confusion ☺.Hope you make more such videos in future

431	NGEN	a	Don't mix liberalism with feminism. U r very dillusional and u don't understand wat the problem with Kabir Singh is. I don't even feel like seeing ur videos every again. Unsubscribing u.. I hope ur daughter gets a bf like Kabir Singh.
432	GEN	a	To call people lke arundhati roy intellectual is absurd. Who has granted or declared her as intellectual? press & some leftist cronies. there are millions in india who are more educated than her, better writers than her, and deeply involved in bringing up social and ethnic problems to the fore. She is an ORM. Over Rated Mediocre. Her writings are pessimistic, rudderless and leftist propaganda. She like other mediocre , has been pumped up by the previous elite institutions. Her writings have not helped any one, beings or beasts, poor or neglected. Her recent statement was of a middle class school student. she should be treated with contempt and disgrace, Shame you stupid Lady.

440	NGEN	a	She is provoking peoples against government by saying we should not give remaining 4 years time to current government...! She is a thread to National security...

445	NGEN	a	I was on verge of being impressed by your (queer) perspective of almost all other movies like Raazi and Mulk coz I had opposite take on these 2 movies. But this one knocked me off. I m done. I can't continue further. God bless you and your subscribers.
446	GEN	a	It’s all very well about gay rights and gay marriage but where the problem lies is there access to kids is coming closer and that’s not right. I’m not racist against blacks or gays but where I do feel strongly is they should not be left around kids. It’s just my opinion and I don’t think I’m too far wrong.

450	NGEN	a	Dowry / Domestic Violence (JUSTICE FOR MEN) Team Nexus is an NGO (Non profit Non GOVT organization), engaged in social work to serve the Families that seek to assist to resolve and recover from minor domestic disputes / tussle / allegations etc. These Families suffer trauma and depression in their attempts to be together again. Our first priority is to save the family by mending the bitter relationship and also know the reality of the allegations irrespective of gender. We directly or indirectly help others to, support the main victims of domestic dispute and domestic violence. Family tension affects people from all walks of life regardless of gender, sexual orientation or race. Men, in particular, suffer because of the lack of recognition and awareness by society and often the lack of local services available to support them. It is a travesty of justice; we cannot silently ignore because we've felt the sting of false accusations made by women of domestic violence or anti dowry act (498A), and resolved to try to prevent this injustice from continuing. We haven't been able to stop it, but we wish to help male victims to fight against injustice side of the system. IF YOU ARE A MALE VICTIM YOU ARE NEITHER “WEAK” NOR “ALONE” CALL US FOR EMOTIONAL AND LEGAL SUPPORT AT :09814055672, CHANDIGARH

494	NGEN	a	Simple way to decide if Kabir Singh is wrong or not. No offense but If you don't mind, imagine your sister whom you love and care about and keep her in Preethi's shoes and kabir as her husband/lover and run the same movie again. If you don't find kabir's action towards preeti offensible then the movie is corrrect. If you think the slapping and kissing without permission is incorrect then the movie has some faults.
495	NGEN	a	I think you are very depressed. You don’t understand ‘consent’
496	NGEN	a	When I start to watch this I was uninterested. I doubted if it's even worth watching. But you guys proved me wrong. Well done. Hope people become more aware of LGBTQ. They are normal human beings just the way we are. I love the girls end act. Mind-blowing performance 👌👌

501	NGEN	a	1000% true bro
502	NGEN	a	Simple the film is showing that they are also women who like flawed abusive men. Have we not seen these women even in our own families? Father is abusive but Mother keeps quiet and lives by him regardless because she loves him. Actually the love of the women here is far more than the men. In this film the female character she see Gabir beyond his flaw that’s what the film is about. That’s why we need to see love beyond flaws. so Gabir Singh with with all his flawed character there was a women who still liked him. That’s why some people liked it. There were already many films like this already made in Tamil films over the last decade the idea was to appeal the audience with a male dominated character to show how an angry person who lives a gal madly and has changed over the time. The only film that showed this very sensibly was acted by Surya in the film Mohabbat Ke Dushman another film was acted by Vikram in Tamil film called Sethu which was redone in Hindi by Salman Khan in Tere Naam. Gabir Singh is actually a rip off from these Two characters nothing more also the female characters was also rip off from the female characters from these two films who were timid characters. So here you go the director got the idea of writing Arjun Reddy from these two films.
503	NGEN	a	nicevedio
504	GEN	a	"Homosexuality : is it natural ?[困] Not to condemn no people, but to reclaim the fallen from this practice, is believing that you can be changed from that stage into a better stage ,to say that we will leave this one off & take the other, who are we to pass that kind of judgment on our brothers & sisters . The Question that should be asked is, where did this perversion of this deviation come about ? Cause when God created this universe & everything in this universe to obey Him & His law , the sun obeys the law under which it is created ,the moon ,the stars , this planet earth obeys the law of its creation. and what we see in the creation is no ,creature deviates from the law under which it is created. The planet moves in its orbit not disobeying the law not even , one fraction of a second & astronomers can bear this witness . i dont care where you find, an ant , a bee , a fowl , a fish. They all obey the nature in which they are created, men is not created to deviate from a certain nature in which he is created. the planet earth is created to incline to the plain of its orbit 23°c ,30 minutes ,The planet inclines to the plain of its orbit, this is a natural inclination or leaning. Man by nature is inclined towards the female & the female by nature leans towards the man. Now i want to know ,where did this , deviation come from? it was not until a man that was made years ago ,from the original man ,made opposite to the nature of the natural man, made to deviate from the natural way of God & man ,made an opposser of the natural way & deviates from the natural course, His whole life style will be a deviation. The Bible clearly says ,he changed the ""TRUTH"" of God into a lie & when you pervert the truth of God & make it a lie ,than what follows from that is a system of perversion of deviation. we didn't have brothers in Africa walking around with broken wrists . since people were taught and learned of this behavior we can un-learn this behavior. Scripture says ""as a man thinketh so is he "" if you make a man to think like a woman ,We have seen that ""Thought"" is so powerful it projects itself totally on the man's brain & it begins to reshape the material so that a man ,who thinks like a woman , his face, his features, his movements everything about him begins to change according to his thoughts. So scripture says "" behold I the sovereign Lord, make all things new"" so we must get ride of the deviation and bring man back into the natural order in which he is created & the only way to do that is to place in mans brain a new thought & that new thought will bring up a new idea and that new idea will reshape the ""matter"" of the man ,change the form of the man & change the expression of the man. There is no such thing as a homosexual that cannot be changed ,there is no such thing as a ""lesbian"" that cannot be changed, God is here to change us all up ,into a new growth & bring us back to the natural order in which we were created."

518	GEN	a	I am an homosexual person and proud to be on my homosexuality ! According to indian constitution we have three genders and homosexuality is legal in India so if someone is saying NO to homosexuality or transgenders this means they are not obeying the indian constitution. I was NCC cadet and when we are in NCC we get a news that army officers or soldiers sometimes they sexually abuse to girlish or an innocent I am the witness I saw this and heard during the NCC period. Next I have made physical relationship with men who were or still they are working with defence forces. So no one can come forward and say that in defence we have no homosexual. There are but they are in closet. Second there are many news where soldiers abused or physically harassed girls so no one can say that if homosexual will join defence so they will tease the or harass the straight soldiers. Homosexual people are normal they are not prostitute who need Sex all the time. Please don’t respect transgender and homosexual people if you don’t want But at least respect your constitution who legalised them According to Ramayana Ram god said kalyug May hijaray Raj karenge God bless you all from your homosexual brother

644	NGEN	a	"Dear Brothers and Sisters, I hope you all get my message well. Last year in April I have arranged for my sister's wedding. We all were happy and had provided some gifts in the form of money and material to (as per their demand) bridegroom's. After few days of marriage she was beaten by her husband and in laws for dowry. We tried many times very carefully because we are from Brahmin society and we can't break marriage. Then after we gone to many times police action and other things but when we go for these actions they become innocent and after few days they again start doing beating and torture to my sister. One day she told ""Bhaiya if I will stay few more day, I will die because of their torture and painless beat"". Then I have decided to go for police and justice. We have lodged FIR after so many resistance of police. We have almost 10-12 wandered for FIR. In May 2017 finally FIR done. But then police took lot of money from them. Police didn't took single action against them so that they can feel guilty about their did. HOW CAN ANYONE SAY POLICE WILL TAKE ACTION SERIOUSLY? NOW POLICE HAS MORE CHANCE TO DO CURRUPTION. IN INDIA DOWRY IS STATUS. I CAN BET 99.99% OF MARRIAGE CASE BOY WILL NOT MARRIED WITH GIRL WITHOUT DOWRY. BECAUSE DOWRY IS NOT ONLY DOWRY IT'S STATUS QUOE AS WELL."

655	NGEN	a	Ye mardangi he kya apke hisab se?? The first scene itself begins with Shahid's character Kabir threatening a girl to take off her clothes at knifepoint.. How is rape any different?? He does many self-destructive, despicable and hurtful things like 1\. Chasing his maid from his flat out of the society gates just for accidentally breaking a glass. 2\. Kissing a girl who he barely knows, without her consent right in the middle of college campus in full public view. 3\. Telling the girl of your dreams that I will kiss your mother and sister 4\. Making her stay at a guys' hostel, apparently out of the care for her 5\. Boasting about the fact that he had alcohol every time before he performed the more than 500 surgeries, without a single one going awry! Strangest part of it all is that nobody seems to oppose him or thrash him black and blue, except for his father. As all this happens, the college authorities and the people around have fevi kwik between their lips and their eye lids.

660	NGEN	a	@Ekta Saikia First of all if my words were harsh then accept my apologies...i am a researcher in engineering by profession and i just believe in the facts and technical reasons only. so, the behavior of any male is completely depends on how his parents raise him and what he's been taught at home ,nothing else can change. Once opinion specially films if we teach everyone that its not real and its just for fun and imagination. Please don't feel so offensive because most of the mans are very good even you might have friends in boys on whom you can trust. one more thing i like iron man so, what does it mean...? should i start jumping from buildings to follow him? its about our born brought up lessons madam from which we are quite able to decide what to learn and what not to... by the way if some guy is bad then nothing can be done because he will sees the negativity around and will do wrong things only, for such persons, jail is right place.

690	NGEN	a	@Pratik Borade Pratik Borade bro 1\. You are not conservative. You are liberal . You are just scared of the word but you are liberal. I have same thought as you but i call myself as liberal. Dude your thoughts are liberals. Most of the thing you said about liberal is not true . Things like nudity and stuff. Indigenous tribe who live naked doesn't know anything. So i dont expect you to tell me what to wear. 2\. Vedas are bullshit. Do u think god wrote the vedas? I am an atheist. If u start questioning vedas you will find it just a book written by prosperous people to control the entire community. How can u relate Mathematics with vedas? Pls dont tell me calculus was invented by vedas. 3\. people of indus valley civilization didn't have any Hindu gods. Vedas are written after indus valley civilization. And zero was in use in Nile Valley Civilizations too. I can't say who used it first. 4 . Liberals oppose war. And you think its a bad thought. On man oh man.. god save me although i dont believe in god. 5\. Vietnam war ......? Seriously... Do u know anything about Vietnam war? 6\. I respect aadiwasi ritual and belief system. Far more logical than hindus but मुझे आदिवासियों के अंधविशवासों प्र विश्वास नहीं। इसलिए मै खुद को conservative नहीं कह सकता आपकी liberal वाली defination से मै खुद को liberal भी नहीं कह सकता क्यों की liberal वह नहीं जो आप बता रहे हो। I love my country and my indigenous culture . The thing is we liberals respect every country and their culture.. लेकिन कहना तो सिर्फ इतना है कि यदि रीति रिवाजों में कुछ कमिया है तो उसको सुधार कर नई अeच्छी बातो को अपनाओ।

725	NGEN	a	"It's a ""Character Driven Story"" , the story of 'Kabir Singh' , the scenes in the movie follows Kabir where the other actors will automatically have less duration and less dialogues. Some feminists and Kiara's fans complaining about very less dialogues for Kiara advani, they didn't even understand that Preeti character was full of expressions who actually was an innocent girl of 19 and drives with Kabir character where both of them feels responsible for the life and family. Before commenting something about the film they should understand the depth of the characters and the new type of scenes which will actually happen in reality."

Although I'm neutral on homosexuality I find it so sad, it makes me so sad to see my people say accepting homosexuality takes them towards development and modernity. We should not try so hard to fit in the west. We are Indian, we should stand back to our own culture. P.S we are ex British colony so my education was always of English so I prefer to write in English.

759	NGEN	a	If people start thinking so logically and can think in such a simple manner then there won;t be any issues in this world and society. Human beings are complex and they have emotions and feelings. This movie was an emotional experience, if you start analyzing emotions logically then you will never able to understand it. Emotions are to feel and not to analyze and people connected with the emotions. This movie does not have any item song neither it shows any female actor where camera is panning on her body parts to titillate the audience and that is very rare in bollywood commercial films with item songs (no one is talking about that). Everything is about the character and its journey - good, bad or ugly and writer should have freedom to create characters as per their will and not as per social morality.
760	NGEN	a	Thank you for enlightening us.

Going by there own narrative..these bastards are in fact the true ""Anti Nationals""(Hindutvavadis). They have contaminated the real plurality and diversified ideals of our culture."

816	GEN	a	always remember this- anything which is remotely disrespectfull to women, ppl like that thing bcuz thats what male ego is. They want to satisfy their own ego and nothing else.
817	NGEN	a	The problem is not the slap scene... the problem is glorification of it!!! And on top of it in your own words you said that it is not necessary that men should always be portrayed as saints in movies accordingly it is not necessary that women should be projected as pure and innocent! Since men have enjoyed the screen space in movies from the inception of movies and gotten away with projected as heroic and manly for molesting, suppress or objectifying women, let our leading ladies have the fun!! Or else let wrong be wrong , no matter which sex it comes from and stay neutral rather than justifying a male character and further inflating male ego and their superiority complex!! But on a more serious note I don’t think every liberals or feminists comes from a place of hating men just like how every conservative does not come from a place of hating women!! Let night he ideologies be used where they are needed!! Why do people have to be so rigid, timid and regressive as well as extremists in following an ideology ( liberal or anti-liberal) for that matter!!! Let’s be more welcoming of change for better and accommodating of age old traditions which are actually good and holistic!!
818	NGEN	a	Bro I would like to say one thing ki is movie me koi problem nai hai except drink and smoke jo ki he youngsters boy possible, isko follow krskte hai kyu , kyuki uska best actor in this movie krrha hai. And one more thing in 4 more shots series me bhi I really object the character of girl journalist who usually do regular random sex. Bro hm SB ek jses nai hai feminist type. But what ever things r not right whether it is done by actor or actress give bad posters in social life, will never appreciated.

893	GEN	a	@Crazy Boy kindly don't get hurt... But read my words what I said.. I said I have come across those gays who have multiple sexual partners.. it's not going to be good.. Single sexual partner will be okay... But what about those who are keeping multiple sexual partners... HIV/HBsAg and Sexually transmitted diseases are more common in these people.. I have one of my patient who had suffered from Bacterial meningitis and then had so many problems in his life. I adore your talent that u have cracked all these exams.. but being a doctor doesn't means that he is not a human being... I live in an Indian society and see what happening in the society...
894	NGEN	a	Nice voice
895	NGEN	a	It was shit from the trailer itself....thank God atleast you got reformed

904	NGEN	a	@डिजिटल लंड भक्त विकास प्राधिकरण Abey yaar, I liked it as a movie. That doesn't mean I'll follow it amd become a drug addict. Yes, I got inspired by the movie to become a topper, excel in sports, and concentrate on career despite having personal problems, being frank and knowing the value of a relationship. Agar tughe buree cheezon se inspire hona hain tho it's your choice 🤷

914	NGEN	a	Amazing video bhai
915	NGEN	a	cont... Our extraordinarily lethargic and incompetent judiciary drag these false cases for years though they very well the truth. All these years husbands and their family members live life like hell. They are blackmailed, extorted, threatened of life. And all this in the name of fake empowerment of women because this serves halwa-poori to the senseless Feminists. Why the law should be gender based and not the crime based? Look around honestly and see who is more victimized: men or women.
916	NGEN	a	Who cares what feminists says!
917	GEN	a	Wonder who those chootiyas are, clapping that India's electoral term is 4 years. RangaBilla? How about the name Kutiya to her?

But seriously Kabir Singh never teach us what is actual life.......
935	NGEN	a	yess broo
936	NGEN	a	It is not a movie review🧐
937	NGEN	a	Completely honest review. We need such honest people in today's generation who can show us how these industries are brainwashing the youth. Twisting the emotions and feelings just to propagate their sick agendas, and make more money. Humanity is at stake. We need people like you to keep the youth on track. Well done sir.
938	NGEN	a	Better not to watch only
939	NGEN	a	I had a very different opinion of the lady.. not any more...go back wherever you came back from..do not teach us to lie...she needs to be deported asap..even the Indian jails should not accept her..whoever has purchased her books..burn them..i am..

953	GEN	a	Fuck yourself Feminism
954	NGEN	a	Wow superb 👌👌👌
955	NGEN	a	Liberals don't want true love stories like Kabir Singh They want multiple relationship movies which spoils the Society ... They want multiple husband and wife....🤦 But in Kabir Singh he loves only one girl she is every thing to him.he likes to lough,sex,quarrel with her only this is called divine love. Kabir Singh is not a movie it is a life of full happiness,sarrow,angry, commitment,love,sacrifice..all...good and bad but we have to take good only. Liberals don't want this type of love. Epic love story ♥️ True love story♥️
956	NGEN	a	I love you bro
957	NGEN	a	Beautiful movie and I don't care about the social impact. If you think like that movie like joker martin scoresee and others movies will be bad

965	NGEN	a	Butifull video
966	GEN	a	Arundhuti Roy's gesturing is of a prostitute,which it means she is really a prostitute. Does the face of her not look like that of a prostitute, warming bed with so many new for being sexually molested most frequently of her own choice? Others also are of the same habits with other male counter parts.
967	NGEN	a	Suprerbacha,chankirchala,gudmarani this is not tanuki mandal fault this her education problem
968	NGEN	a	I'm not a liberal or a feminist...I do none of the things mentioned by the chap in the video...but, sorry to say, Kabir Singh, is an absolute bore Really not sure what traditions Kabir Singh is promoting. I don't know what this chap is going on about
969	NGEN	a	Thankew
970	NGEN	a	@Beant Singh how is telling people to lie and forge fake details is telling the truth.
971	GEN	a	He was not Womanizer. He was destroyed inside & very angry . When that girl having fiance & having sex with another boy then feminists don't have problem .
972	NGEN	a	@pratikborade sir @zoomtv is one of the best example of feminism. Not just controversies like kabir singh or nana patekar and tanushree datta but many more other issues which had no point debating, they are just liberals.
973	NGEN	a	apymvideo
974	NGEN	a	can these things be done in any other country
975	NGEN	a	I am ur hater.... but in this video i agree with you
976	NGEN	a	Thank you bro one's again💓 best reviewer of India 😊💓
977	NGEN	a	GODI media king ...
978	NGEN	a	Arundhati Roy must be killed
979	NGEN	a	I can’t think of the the worst word for her. Because even the worst word is not enough for her.
980	NGEN	a	We all knew that the movie was a little over the top. The main issue was the selective outrage from the Feminist brigade. They critise certain movies that potray male lead characters as Dominant and vile. But at the same time they encourage toxic female behaviours in movies . Who treat Their male counterparts as DOG SHIT We somehow had to defend Kabir Singh There was no other way around
981	NGEN	a	Waiting for the joker's review
982	NGEN	a	Be happy and healthy.
983	NGEN	a	So then why he signed the movie???
984	NGEN	a	Abhishek kumar hiii
985	NGEN	a	U r inspiration i work everyday because of u
986	NGEN	a	I was waiting for this video since a long time 😀😀
987	NGEN	a	I did not see the movie till now. Did not like the trailer, it was showing unrealistic illogical thing . 😅.
988	NGEN	a	Agree!
989	NGEN	a	Is anyone out there in the Bollywood daring to make a path breaking psychological or sci fi thriller without imposing any propoganda or portraying all men as stupid lovers like they have nothing to achieve more than their soulmate that too without imitating a Hollywood movie?
990	NGEN	a	Sir i respect u very much. But i am here for kabir singh review not for liberals people review. Plz review the movie. Thank u.
991	NGEN	a	Women protesting against **Kabir Singh** were the same ones who praised **Veere Di Wedding** because of its toxic pseudo feminist attitude, being so called independent in life and treating your man as a dog after your marriage. Pseudo Feminists are hypocrites [#FeminsimSucks](http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23FeminsimSucks)
992	NGEN	a	Such videos circulating are super necessary. Pros of internet.
993	NGEN	a	Heroin is pregnant, pregnancy is good news. As we always refer, yar good news hai main baap banne wala hun. Our youngsters give up and in depression they get in to drugs destroying their life. While at the other end a good news is waiting. This positive message this film gives to our youth.
994	NGEN	a	Yes finally found a very good review for Kabir Singh I want this video to get million views
995	NGEN	a	Attitude and attitude
996	NGEN	a	Nice topic
997	NGEN	a	"s this is what happen, if 498a is not controlled. Man this nation is going in path of falling in pit of shit. The young Man Lifes are in risk because of 498a. Beware before getting married. marry ""good women"" not ""Devil"" because Devil will able to change face anything anywhere."
998	NGEN	a	Shame on you, no doubt India is still developing. This country is going to the dogs. 1880s ki thinking hai bhai tumhari, band kr de videos bnana. You are circulating suppressive ideology. Literally go and read and educate yourself.

1001	NGEN	a	After so many days I see this chutyia face. wow yar u are remain same chutiya as much as you were before. Get well soon.
1002	NGEN	a	"Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Expressgiving the film one-and-a-half stars out of five,opined, ""Kabir Singh (protagonist) is all flourish, mostly surface. You see him going through the motions, but you never really feel for him. And that, right there, is the problem: not enough pay off for three hours of pain."".[45] Raja Sen of Hindustan Times, agreeing with Gupta, gave one-and-a- half stars out of five and felt that it was the most misogynistic Indian film that had come in a long time. He praised the cinematography of Santhana Krishnan Ravichandran but criticised the other aspects of the film. He said, ""Kabir Singhactually applauds its pathetic protagonist, and ends up an obnoxious celebration of toxic masculinity.""[46] Kunal Guha of Mumbai Mirror rated the film two-and-a-half stars out of five, feeling that trimming the script by forty minutes would have helped.[47] Arnab Banerjee of Deccan Chroniclerated the film 1.5 stars out of 5, writing, ""Besides it's misogyny that gives its ""hero"" the right to make decisions on behalf of his girlfriend, and even kiss her as and when he pleases, there is yet another major problem with the film: Shahid Kapoor."" IN SAB FALTU LOGO KI REVIEW KARNE WALI BAATE KAALPANIK HAI INKA KISI BHI ACHHI MOVIE KE REVIEW SE KOI SAMBHADH NAHI HAI. AGAR HAI TO O MATRA EK SANYOG MANA JAYEGA..

1004	NGEN	a	I see all girls in Sucharita Tyagi's video and all guys gathered here. Honestly, can we stop with this morality act. It's true that if Kabir Singh was a girl this film wouldn't have worked, we need to accept both sides of the coin. And I'm pretty sure that if this was a girl's story the girls would be defending and ladko ki jalti buri wali. Anyway, I don't morally judge, and you are absolutely right in your review. It's a good film with raw and well shaped characters and i appreciate their effort. 🙂
1005	NGEN	a	Bhai Artical 15 Dekho. One of the great movie in 2019..

1027	NGEN	a	Right bro'' You are absolutely right
1028	NGEN	a	JOKER Review Please..
1029	NGEN	a	That's right
1030	NGEN	a	Hello Pratik, You have said in multiple videos about the importance of having an opinion and the right to express that. Now an opinion depends on different thoughts, situations,beliefs,background,relationships,experiences etc on a very personal level. Difference on every aspect of life is the beautiful essence of the very existence of human being. I, personally agree with many of your thoughts but at the same time dont agree with some opinions. My question is why is it so important to put a tag or lebelize the ones who have different thoughts or dont agree with yours point of view? Why does everybody (who dont share the opinions as yours) have to be a 'feminazi', 'liberal' etc? Dont you think we should be respectful and polite to viewers ( more so because we are all educated and well read people) in a public domain? Aggression is good when applied cleverly and certainly not in unidimensional rage. Where is the Pratik who used to review The Apu Trilogy with love, care and utmost sincere humility?
1031	NGEN	a	This film is only about couple who passionate about love don't know what has happened to society.
1032	NGEN	a	Love Is Pure bro. Kabir beautifully tells us that
1033	NGEN	a	Wow u explained it very clearly.

1045	NGEN	a	Plz bro. Dont blame bollywood for it. The main culprit is that director Sandeep Vanga who also made Arjun Reddy and remade it in Hindi... He totally destroyed the lives of youth.😡😡😡😡😡😡
1046	NGEN	a	I badly agree with you

1056	NGEN	a	Sir what about anime??
1057	NGEN	a	I was eagerly waiting for Mensutras review on This Shitty Kabir singh movie. I havent watched it yet but before that i want to know your opinion. Now i feel ,I saved my time by not watching this Senseless movie.
1058	NGEN	a	Who's that?
1059	NGEN	a	@Sandeep Meena Bible is the only word of God in this world that changes lives...Bible has built the most developed countries of the west and has contributed to the progress in science and technology.... without Bible there would be no scientific development and progress... Geeta has contributed to the misery and hopelessness that India shoes... following geeta India has become a poor and non productive society... If India accepts the true God Yahweh(Jesus) of the Bible...India will be developed and prosperous...i mean all of them...not only few rich people but whole society will change....because only Jesus is the way to God the Father and he is way to heaven...and only Jesus give salvation and eternal life.
1060	NGEN	a	At that time of its releasing date, I decided to watch ARTICLE 15, and truly, it is much times better than KABIR SINGH, even many of my friends critised me, for that I dont know what feelings are? What love is? I will repeat again, many of us don't have the gut to watch and accept the truth showed in ARTICLE 15. And for sure KABIR SINGH is a garbage. Because it destroyed true meaning of LOVE. Awesome video Shwetabh Sir💁‍♂️🙋‍♂️
1061	NGEN	a	You said exactly what I wanted to say. In fact usually I don't watch love stories but I came across a review by a feminazi who bashed the movie. I immediately decided... ab toh zaroor dekhunga 😈
1062	NGEN	a	You're right shwetabh .....Ayushman is great future of Bollywood 👌 ✌

1069	NGEN	a	Your opinion exactly matches with my opinion when I have seen Arjun reddy. Original version of Kabir Singh. It's the dumbest film lack of heroism.
1070	NGEN	a	Hat's off to you bro ......absolutely right
1071	NGEN	a	This channel gives me hope.

1074	NGEN	a	totally wrong story...i doesn't happens..he shouldn't killed his wife...He has to tell his wife everything about him rather than to do this crime...i think a real gay couples never do [this.It](http://this.it/) was just imagine story that doesn't exist nd can't happens in real [life.so](http://life.so/) i don't like this movie.. That's why l'm disliking this movie.

1097	NGEN	a	Bhai bahut sahi Kaha aapne. Liberals and feminists have become clowns of the world. They have problem with everything. I'm a big fan of you and your honesty.
1098	GEN	a	All theatres screening Kabir Singh should display a warning - Dogs and Feminists not allowed 😂😂
1099	GEN	a	if movies are like our real life why making movies then ? no entertainement , unique problème is just we have to learn that this is not reality and we have to stop being madarchod
1100	NGEN	a	@Samy ThakurYou are just turning a blind eye on the real issue.Feminism now doesnt mean equal rights,now it's just a way to spread hate.check any recent event and while we are at it liberalism too has become just a word but what these liberals are doing is trying to break India
1101	NGEN	a	Some things are true but i feel he is exaggerating. Har kisi ki personality ek nhi hoti. Some people are impulsive
1102	NGEN	a	Trailer hi jhand tha. Bollywood is garbage except 10 ℅ movies
1103	NGEN	a	Love the way that boy was crying..haha
1104	GEN	a	Keep away from that mad aunty.

1106	NGEN	a	willing to respect or accept behavior or opinions different from one's own; open to new ideas --------of course this is the worst thing? Pratik ? we should be not respect others, see other's view or open to more ideas ??????????
1107	NGEN	a	Beginning was marked with 'Veere Di Wedding', 'Lust Stories' and 'Four More Shots'.
1108	NGEN	a	I am sorry to say, some people, not necessarily bad people, get energized by opportunities for anarchy. Burning the place down is not the way to build a bright new society.
1109	NGEN	a	Vomit
1110	NGEN	a	No one is more honest than this person. He is saving a generation. HIT A LIKE IF YOU LOVE AND RESPECT HIM.
1111	NGEN	a	Arundhati Roy should be behind bars

1123	NGEN	a	Review Tumbbad.
1124	NGEN	a	I totally agree bro
1125	NGEN	a	You're always right but there always been a positive aspect for this movie and that is the performance especially by shahid kapoor. People's are loving to see the character of kabir and how shahid played it. What I want to say is shahid nailed it as a character.
1126	NGEN	a	@Meghna S you are mixing things..Sanju was a biography.. And the director had to show Sanjay duty's life.. so ppl have truly criticised Sanjay dutt for doing wot ever he has done in lyf.. But this one is a fictional movie.. Here director had the scope to show wot ever he wanted to show.. Working with mass media is a great responsibility.. Director s should be more careful about that. Are regarding hypocrisy.. we should learn to respect every kind of opinion.. judging people's opinion and tagging them with names are unnecessary.. This channel specifically is to review movies and we all come here for that.. Do you really think this kind of vedio was necessary?? Or shall we take it as a paid publicity stunt!!!!
1127	NGEN	a	Leonardo DiCaprio purchase his on screen wife in Wolf of wallstreet. feminists = OMG leo is so handsome he deserves Oscar for this. Shahid kapoor plays an intense role of kabir Singh Feminists = this is misogyny, patriarchy male dominance, chauvinist,supremacist...L&L
1128	NGEN	a	Rajdeep such a shame Right to free speech comes with reasonable restrictions read Art 19(2)
1129	NGEN	a	Politics + Media + Religion + nuclear weapons = destruction

1159	NGEN	a	<https://youtu.be/yNdB772uAsU>
1160	NGEN	a	Hii Pratik ji...I really liked your video and I too agree to your perspective. I watched the movie today and I don't feel that it's anyway hurting 'the so- called feminist ego'. Instead the entire movie is all about acknowledging the character Kabir's issues, faults mistakes, failures and his unconditional love for Preeti. The culmination of the movie speaks for itself.. wherein a changed Kabir, fully in realisation of his blunders finally meets his love of his life Preeti, who is Not The Victim but the final and true saviour of Kabir. I really don't support the so-called feminism which is now seen hovering in the air. Instead I support true feminism--equality for both the sexes, male as well as female without any kind of discrimination on any ground. Also, negative values are negative for everyone.. Irrespective of men and women.
1161	NGEN	a	This Roy lady should not be allowed to enter India ban her she is dirt messing with true Indians Jaihind

1339	NGEN	a	Similarly liberals also should stop bashing everything else. It's a mutual coexistence. And to be true, liberals are hypocrites. We saw liberals silent during Sanju movie release, now with Kabir Singh they have problems. So really can't trust their motive
1340	NGEN	a	Movie revolves around hero only because name of movie is kabir singh and not preety sikka.😒😒

1360	NGEN	a	Pratik sir at his best👍😂😂👍 [#savage](http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23savage)
1361	NGEN	a	I didn't hate this movie......but I can understand ....why people are so much up in arms against this movie......the problem starts when ...people who watched this movie....starts to replicate behaviour of Kabir Singh ...in their lives.....and then pose threat to other people around them......that's where the core problem stems from.... does someone agree..??
1362	NGEN	a	You are nice
1363	NGEN	a	All dislikes are coming from that type of faminism and liberal chutiya persons....
1364	NGEN	a	These people want our country be destroyed. They only want violence and destruction in the country.
1365	NGEN	a	she is best magi.......right now
1366	GEN	a	I respect homosexuals....but.. homosexuals tend to catch hiv infection... millitary personal do donate blood.....and also have to donate blood during emergency or war situation when other person is injured...also there is lots of blood shed in war which makes infection to being spread Conclusion:- no and if recruited there should be complete testing and prevention of infection...this includes monitoring the sexual activities of personal (most probably impossible)....thus instead we can invest more in straight personnel with no infections Note:-this is my view ,again [#nooffence](http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23nooffence)
1367	NGEN	a	I was EAGERLY waiting for a review of KABIR SINGH like this. The TRUE fact nobody is talking about. Every fucking reviewer and critique are praising the movie which was really weird for me. I think they are all sold out. They just don't want hate since all the viewers are chutiya and they are going ham on any video who give negative review on movie. BUT YOU ARE HONEST.

1384	NGEN	a	Honest & Perfect Review Sir, best answer to Film Companion 💓
1385	NGEN	a	1 - he loves turly so he kissed her infront of family members in her home what a respectable man to love a women ! 2 - he accepted his ban Coz he knew if he will not so the drinking habbit will continue so it was a clever desion ! 3 - in end she slapped so right reason lefting her in someone else arms for night pleasure ..he could not get any information how she is ..& where is she ! 4 - one of the looser act it was she can't talk her family for own marriage again here Kabir is moron didn't send their family to convey if his family not agreed with this relationship so they both leave their home & got court marriage simple ! Pethetic shit film
1386	NGEN	a	Urban naxal spotted
1387	NGEN	a	This is wrong .
1388	NGEN	a	I m extremly feeling bad after watching this..yestrday i commented on Kabir singh A weird.heroism .but now i realised i was wrong.. Seriously four more shots web series ..veerey di wedding...bs kabir singh. An eye opener
1389	NGEN	a	This film about gay people is rubbish. How could you come up with a horrific video like this. Shame on you.
1390	NGEN	a	<https://youtu.be/sEOVutUpRA0> Pratik bhai my humble request please please listen this... I know you understand gujarati very well...you will definitely love it 🙏🙏💓
1391	NGEN	a	But the video has a good meaning and hillerious took
1392	NGEN	a	Funny how it just happens in North India especially hindi speaking states. Destroying Hindu culture is fashion, Salman Khan can run over people and kill animals no one will say anything. So funny north india
1393	NGEN	a	Very true ! And best analysis covering all things :) great work Bhai .
1394	NGEN	a	Subscried bhai.. U said everything thing right, but bottom line is that these indians mind set never changes..
1395	NGEN	a	This movie tells us that if fall in love with someone and she is not with you than need to do is drink and drink again and again that's all
1396	GEN	a	Stop it u bootlicker of bjp... Bhainchod aur kitna chaaatogey tum log bjp ki... Arnab Goswami is the most dirtiest blot of India... Bhainchod... Shouting like a mad dog with four other dogs in ur show doesn't make u patriot.... Loudey u r just a pimp cum anchor.... U coward if u have guts then go out n take the interview of the students who r protesting.... Inviting four to five bhakts every night n vomits ur shits from ur mouth doesn't make u journalist
1397	NGEN	a	[16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ZMfQMZos0&t=16m48s) savage level 100%😂😂😂
1398	NGEN	a	Absolutely correct . Feminism should mean equal rights for both men and women 🙆
1399	NGEN	a	I was cried at the end of the movie..... Weeped like a child 😭😭
1400	NGEN	a	why isn't she arrested. She must be put behind bars & prosecuted for sedition & punished as per law .

1405	NGEN	a	Waiting for book
1406	NGEN	a	Feminist fuck up🤣🤣🤣
1407	NGEN	a	I'm a feminist and I love Arjun Reddy and Kabir Singh...people who think otherwise have missed the whole point.
1408	NGEN	a	Rajdeep true journalist not like ravish Kumar or Arnab Goswami. Both are same first one leftists other one is rightist but only Rajdeep don't take side he is true journalist.👍👌
1409	NGEN	a	Great said
1410	NGEN	a	Reason to watch Hollywood
1411	GEN	a	Don't call her prostitute because prostitute just sell their bodies for their survival but they don't sells their morals. But arundhati Roy sells her morilaty . And who knows she might sell her body and Raul khan might be the result
1412	NGEN	a	Feminism and 3rd wave feminism are two completely different things. 3rd wave feminism is all about attacking men and misandry. And of course Toxic masculinity exists,no one can deny that. 3rd wave feminism is basically toxic feminism. They're the two sides of one coin.
1413	NGEN	a	I agree with you. This is the first video of your's that I am watching and I completely agree with the hypocrisy of the ultra left liberal feminist (feminazis).
1414	NGEN	a	Ye buddi kunhei yar? Arundathi Billy ya kungfu kutta? I can't understand yar?
1415	NGEN	a	there should me a law to punish the people who keep false cases....so that this type of incidents couldn't happen
1416	NGEN	a	This anti nation lady is misguiding the peoples and telling lies,arrest this type of activites
1417	NGEN	a	That's why I watch your every reviews
1418	GEN	a	@ajay bhagat These Gays And Lesbos are Basically Opposing the Laws Of Nature
1419	NGEN	a	This movie is just a waste of time. This Movie is only movie for immature people who don't distinguished between love and lust.
1420	NGEN	a	699 Kabirtard dislike the video
1421	NGEN	a	@gabru yeah! You're right i agree with you
1422	NGEN	a	Best vedio

1424	NGEN	a	I have not watched this movie yet. But watching this video only for Shwetabh bhai. Edit - I don't watch indian movies.
1425	GEN	a	Fuck those feminism and liberals film no.1 hai
1426	NGEN	a	Well, I have found something in India, Lesbian girls are soooo beautiful in this country, do you agree?
1427	NGEN	a	Faking grill opu
1428	GEN	a	Saw the. Entire review and she is gandu feminist
1429	NGEN	a	Those are not said with the intention of disrespecting women, if you cannot see that, maybe you're blinded by the ideas of feminazis.
1430	NGEN	a	WE CAN UNDERSTAND PEOPLE LIKE HER HAVE THEIR OWN STUMOC TO FILL AND NEED SOMETHING TO DO FOR THEIR LIVELIHOOD. BUT BETTER THEY SEARCH FOR OTHER DECENT BUSINESS FOR THEIR LIVELIHOOD
1431	NGEN	a	God please give him past life
1432	NGEN	a	Ranga Billa parents of leftists and lutians.....
1433	NGEN	a	You changed your channel name!

1438	GEN	a	She tells her name as Randi, gandwa as her father, jugaad as mother😂😂😂😂
1439	NGEN	a	Acting.. Direction..Music. Back ground ch .. Screenplay ch sanga na
1440	NGEN	a	Where is the review of kabir Singh..
1441	NGEN	a	Akshay Kumar pe video banao that how he's making fool of public by making patriotic movies.
1442	NGEN	a	Dude atleast trim properly

1445	NGEN	a	RX-100........Tamil movie...u should watch..That was a slap on feminism..
1446	NGEN	a	Thanos ..... Snape....
1447	NGEN	a	I totally agree with you. You nailed it. Kabir Singh should not be celebrated. It gives wrong message to the people. Finally watch someone criticised this film with a swag and you raised very valid points. Supporters of this film will have no place to hide and no counter arguments left.
1448	NGEN	a	good news agiajuo
1449	NGEN	a	Hahahahahaaah
1450	NGEN	a	One of the best movie of the year and what a acting by Shahid real rockstar for me 👌
1451	NGEN	a	"Three words for those liberals who think they can change my mind according to their view ""I Don't Care"" Because I don't permit anyone to impose their thought on me."
1452	NGEN	a	I know arnab is govt funded but on this point I agree that arundhati roy not required in India.
1453	NGEN	a	That's the sad truth, most people are easily influenced in India.
1454	NGEN	a	That's why i stopped watching film companion movie reviews...
1455	NGEN	a	Simple....she is funded by People's Republic of China for spreading naxalism and maoism. She wants India's economic growth to minimize by causing chaos so, China can easily become superpower after beating USA without having any competition from India. Every left liberal around the world knows only India can compete with China economically and militarily which they don't want to see happening.
1456	NGEN	a	Dude I watched this movie like last week!
1457	GEN	a	Fuck boy: चोदू लड़का। 😂😂😂
1458	NGEN	a	nice drama....
1459	NGEN	a	My previous comment: I don't think it's right to forcefully insert topics of feminism and liberals in every video, it shakes the moral purpose of the video i.e. movie review. After watching for 5 mins: Your videos are great. You are great ! Jai Hind ! Vande Mataram 🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳
1460	NGEN	a	Pratik bhai we are with u against liberals
1461	NGEN	a	Toooooooooo much...respected sir.

1464	NGEN	a	@TANMAY jain did you even watch the video? The first half of the video he was literally explaining that only.
1465	NGEN	a	@jessicagreenwalt 498a is i.p.c. This code shows how to rob husbands house and destroy the family. This is most uncivilised law of India and this comes from America and Britain. Look at the divorce rate.
1466	NGEN	a	Its not petrol... Its crime patrol...
1467	NGEN	a	Ye kuch reviewers, (Quint, Film Companion) is movie pe tut hi pade hai jaise ye pure Bollywood me sabse kharab movie ho. Wo log bol rahe hai ki, Preeti ke character ko bahot submissive bataya hai. Mujhe to nahi laga dekh ke. Infact she was keeping her points, and stuck to them. Your analysis of other's opinions is exactly correct. Great review.
1468	NGEN	a	Please dump her Bharat know the country of Sita and Savitri not this types of xyz
1469	NGEN	a	Can be framed proper right to express, right to speech.

1475	NGEN	a	Yeah right, because tigers can sign a legal contract. Idiot! Besides, decriminalizing gay sex doesn't mean gay marriage is legal yet.
1476	NGEN	a	Wtever. Modern Feminism IS dog shit
1477	NGEN	a	Cheapest message I ever seen in YouTube
1478	NGEN	a	Because ashiqui 2 was remake of Hollywood movie A STAR IS BORN therefore that movie is realistic

1480	NGEN	a	Nobody can understand the pain of such husbands
1481	NGEN	a	Much more complex than Preeti 🤣🤣

1496	GEN	a	This lady doesn't even know that a term in India lasts for 5 years not 4 years. Saali America de yaha hero banne ke liye aayi hai. That's where the term is for 4 years
1497	NGEN	a	Emotions must be analysed. Or you're literally the slave of your emotions.
1498	NGEN	a	She is so much intelligent
1499	NGEN	a	Awesome movie
1500	GEN	a	The process can be tested by taking them in army and recording their activities which data can be further used for the study on effect of homosexuality on army efficiency.

1505	NGEN	a	Learn from everyone follow no one🚶....
1506	NGEN	a	Nowadays shortmovies is far better than Bollywood mainstream movies

1511	NGEN	a	Top Sameer punjabi hi

1514	NGEN	a	I . Just. Fell. In. Love. With . This. Guy's. personality and way of thinking. 🙌 he diced the movie plot precisely. Everything he says is very realistic. Respect from a Pakistani girl. You go Sirrrr.
1515	NGEN	a	Liquor should be totally banned. Administration and police must be strict and such actions should be dealt with iron hand. People should be alert and aware. Bengal is fast becoming hell.
1516	NGEN	a	@Be Positive The kind of INSULTS and ACCUSATIONS you have berated me with reveal the true Nature of Feminism.
1517	NGEN	a	Why the eccentric lady is still in India?
1518	NGEN	a	Kabir Singh is far better than Hindi garbage movies and hinduphobic chutiya movies

1527	NGEN	a	Not liberal opposing but people of Bajrang Dal, Shiv Sena, Karni Sena & anti romeo squad gang opposing the movie
1528	NGEN	a	Freedom of speech does not give anyone the right to incite people to commit crimes. Kastori shankar is stupid. Nupur is absolutely right.
1529	NGEN	a	arjun reddy was also a morally ethically destructive film ...
1530	NGEN	a	Love your review, first to watch
1531	NGEN	a	osm video
1532	NGEN	a	@mr gojiya hlo ji

1534	NGEN	a	Nice acting guys mind blowing
1535	NGEN	a	@Mahesh Thakur Actually pratik is one of the few critics whom we can trust and he is leading the Bollywood industry and audience in a good direction.

1547	NGEN	a	There is no one character of doctor like kabir Singh..its a movie nothing else. Bollywood movies has to more improve . They impact negative thoughts to the whole youth.
1548	NGEN	a	Burnol mate?
1549	NGEN	a	Gay sex should be banned..........
1550	NGEN	a	Bhai 'TUMBBAD' dekho Amazon prime pe hai. You won't regret it. And if you like then please review it here. It need more recognition.
1551	NGEN	a	They Are doing for food, nothing more
1552	NGEN	a	This woman is high on some cheap crack.
1553	NGEN	a	And video shows that every criminal has right to crime because we’re born criminal and if we’re agreed to become criminal than it’s God decision
1554	NGEN	a	M gay n proud of myself
1555	NGEN	a	bull shit . you fucking mind. gays are not criminals. this video showing wrong image
1556	NGEN	a	Its worth watching instead of wasting time on PUBG
1557	NGEN	a	"I think Kabir Singh is appealing to alot of women/men because, despite him being a naracissistic, abusive, uncivil, alcoholic, woman threatening, manslut, addict...he's a rich guy, with a rich family and also, he's apparently a very talented surgeon. If you minus all the wealth and his profession, and he's a middle class ordinary guy with all the negative qualities, then it would be a hit episode of crime patrol. It's similar to those 50 shades movie, the guy is ""hot"" because he has tons of cash. I have watched the movie to see what the hype is about, honestly, the girl was blander than Bella Swan in Twilight. And what the heck does, ""I love the way you breathe"" mean? Goodness gracious."
1558	NGEN	a	People like Kabir Singh in real life would have needed lots of psychiatric counseling and therapy. He has ASPD and substance abuse issues. Love is not equal to obsession. This is not a good love story this is limerence. You don't have to be a feminist to notice this.
1559	NGEN	a	Getting friendzoned!
1560	NGEN	a	Yess bro yess
1561	NGEN	a	those who r promoting this, i wish their parents were also in favour of that so those stupids wouldn't have been born.

1563	NGEN	a	Yes u are right...but 90 % of men supports women without knowing anything about and these men do not know what are happening on men by women all over the country....
1564	NGEN	a	Bhai love u a lot big fan launde kya haal best dilogue
1565	NGEN	a	Bakwas movie..bt Shahid Kapoor's acting was fantastic
1566	NGEN	a	@Truthshallsetyoufree some random guy who was born 2000 years ago is your god. Who doesn't even know what the world is right now in the year 2019 . He is going to preach me those things which he thought was right 2000 years ago at a completely different place and time and you think by applying those thoughts my life would be happy. Get a life Christian missionary, but if you are getting paid for it then all the best. At the end it's all about self convenience.
1567	NGEN	a	Nice shayri
1568	NGEN	a	They killed husbands parents....they destroyed life of this man.. so they have to be punished like this totally agree
1569	NGEN	a	This Congress bugger why disrupting the debate, he needs a good kick.
1570	GEN	a	load of crap, it isn't directors responsibility to teach anyone the moral values, it isn't any moral science lecture, the idiots who gets inspired from Kabir Singh is not directors responsibility... And whats your fucking problem with love at first sight, anything sounds bullshit in a sarcastic sound. And how stupid are you asking about heroine's backstory when the movie is about protagonists self destruction, and why the fucking are you comparing the movie with reality, not just bollywood anything on silver screen will be absolutely fucking different from reality sucker. STAY IN YOUR REALITY FUCKER BETTER DONT WATCH MOVIES FOR INSPIRATION AS A STUPID.
1571	NGEN	a	Boys n girls should have equal rights. Whats deemed right for girls should right for boys too n vice versa
1572	NGEN	a	<https://youtu.be/ghDIOlPnaA4>

1584	NGEN	a	What was the meaning of that two English words
1585	NGEN	a	Well it's good to see all the citizens of the country fighting against one another just like the old times before the Britishers came and became masters of us..Took more than a hundred years to be free and now seems like we're gonna destroy one another with our bare hands without the help of British...Well done..

1591	NGEN	a	she might or should be subjected to sometime Ranga Billa acts and should be subjected to vulnerable situation that she should beg for herself and mercy...why she is criticizing and always a face of controversy...such writers always do that make their books famous...they can go to any unethical level...they take advantage of mob psychology also... .such cold blooded people are born to eat the ghee or butter - as old saying...from the dead ones funeral...

1603	NGEN	a	[#BestReviewer](http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23BestReviewer)!🔥 [#Logical](http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23Logical) These feminists and liberals are...immature....don't know,why do they go to watch adult movies when they are not matured.
1604	GEN	a	She really have Randy look.
1605	NGEN	a	Why the govt is allowing her to spread hatred against India ?
1606	NGEN	a	Does this Arundhati Roy have a brain? She is being seditious urging the members of the Indians at large to provide false information to the Government in the serious business of organizing and putting order to run the country. What's her business in this? She should be mailed.
1607	NGEN	a	wow.....👍👍👍👍👍👍👍 good
1608	NGEN	a	"Plz make "" Joker movie "" review ..sir"
1609	NGEN	a	you did not get the point. unnecessarily mixing up politics and feminism and everything else like khichdi. if some people had a problem with a lead character who has terrible anger issues and acts violent and entitled and like a jerk and rolls his life away in alcohol and drugs - that is a very very pathetic and unattractive character. there are people like that in real life... who bring down everyone around them because of a break up. i think showing why the character is like this... delving deeper into his anger issues, his insecurities would be a better movie... jab dekho love love love... kya bakwas...ask any psychiatrist and they will tell you this is some kind of personality disorder. thats what people are talking about... stop blaming feminism all the time to justify weirdos. having said that, i am sure shahid has done a great job in this character. i just hope not many men waste their life in alcohol after watching this movie thinking they are doing in it the name of LOVE.
1610	NGEN	a	I feel you bro... 🙇
1611	NGEN	a	Every one in the world got flaws and who argues against is an hypocrite just like you asshole. An movies are based on how engaged are you watching the story and characters response to situation, not judging their morals... How dumb are you? I really thought this is a good channel.
1612	NGEN	a	Now watch shwetabh Gangwar's analysis about Kabir singh. Your review seems comedy infront of him.

1615	GEN	a	@parul singh It's not true.... but yeah... due to too much indecency of women in society and the way media using them as an object or piece of meat to seduce men, many men also are running behind these girls to lick them... at least you are not their target... but those men who became monster watching this nudity and lost control over themselves, you can be target for them.... Each fuckbois do not see whether you are simple girl or bold... they just wants your body.... So, take care.... Values of women and respect for them are getting down day by day... In future, may be maximum men would became fuckbois just because of this obscenities all around.... Today, it's hard to find a genuine girl or boy....

1620	NGEN	a	Till the climax Arjun Reddy goes as if it was going to show the real consiquences of toxic masculinity and forced love. Its has many real elements of upper caste elitism, stalhome syndrome and self distructive tendencies. But in end it goes on to dump the whole setup in dump and heads for a typical bollywood style fairytail ending.

1632	NGEN	a	Hello mister....kabir singh is a achi cheez...u don't know how many family are destroyed by drinking.....
1633	NGEN	a	Bakwaas baate hai ye..talking about liberals and feminists is not the issue.its about the basic moral values... hooting on a guy slapping a woman is not funny... molesting a girl just because you are her senior is not funny... this is a reality I know but glorifying it is a mistake..and such a happy ending of the film made Kabir Singh a hero..which he was totally not.What he was doing during the whole film is simply not right.And it's you who support all this..because for you he is a hero..maybe you want to become like him.This film will just mislead the youth.Shame on everyone who are a part of this stupid film.
1634	NGEN	a	please put english subtitles.
1635	NGEN	a	No👍 😜
1636	NGEN	a	@Shashank Singh I agree with you 1 -he loves turly so he kissed her infront of family members in her home what is respectable man to love a women ! 2 - he accepted his ban Coz he knew if he will not so the drinking habbit will continue so it was a clever desion ! 3 - she slapped so right reason lefting her in someone else arms for night pleasure ..he could not get any information how she is ..& where is she ! 4 - one of the looser act when Kabir slapped her she can't talk her family for own marriage again here Kabir is moron didn't send their family to convey if his family not agreed with this relationship so they both leave their home & got court marriage simple ! Fucking film !
1637	GEN	a	@Eminent - pubg Mobile chutiya pubg pussy Indian spotted
1638	NGEN	a	The problem is that he shows a knife to a girl to remove her clothes on knife point , he openly announces that girl is his without her consent , and objectification of fat girl should be with beautiful girl is pathetic.

1650	NGEN	a	First of all we have to watch movie for entertainment only..every time we can’t judge movie if we are not getting anything from it(i am talking about individual)..i am agree with Shwetabh bhai for some opinion but Kabir Singh has lots of other elements to analyse..Basically movie main character ke point of view se dikhayi hai aur movie dekh ke hum apana dimag kharab kar rahe then i am sorry hum movie aur real life ko samaz nhi rahe hai..you have to be very practical about yourself,society,movie and reviews like this..end of the day life money pe chalti hai not these movie..again person to person differ karta hai..it’s not about right or wrong but different perception only.

1659	NGEN	a	Toxic feminism is the best comedy ever happened to the world. And now INDIA has it too so let's have fun with it😄
1660	NGEN	a	Malimatth Committee prediction is coming true. Though this is wrong and I condemn this act, this is bound to happen. The way the Indian Govt is treating men in general and Indian husbands in particular Indian men are left with no choice. The shallow feminists, national commission of women and Women and child ministry are openly encouraging women to file false cases agains husbands and their families. They are openly pampering women to commit crimes and then put on mask of victimhood.

1772	NGEN	a	You are true. But people should understand that they are going to watch a movie that is only for entertainment. I think wise people don't get influenced by such movies. People also loved the movie due to shahid kapoor's acting. He should also play inspiring movies too. All those actors who have list of garbage movies, also have played inspiring movies too. The only problem is that the list of good movies are less. So, the main problem is that the most of the people want excuse for themselves and act like movie characters. Some people don't even realize that they are getting influenced. And some people are followers of those group who can't speak out like swetabh sir 🤣🤣🤣🤣 even if they know the truth 😆😆😆

1797	NGEN	a	I really hate the way the debate are presented why can you not have civilized conversation let one speak mute all others. Then give chance to other to respond and mute all others. Very frustrating to watch people yelling over each other. It's up to the team at Republic tv to control this. I like this program debates but the childish yelling over each other. People need to know valid points from both sides not name calling, I would like to see India progress and it starts with information which is the MEDIA !!! Please grow up.
1798	GEN	a	Homosexuality is prohibited in almost every major religion. So we should not follow western culture(even banned in Christianity). Our creator, the Almighty has made our metabolism in such a way that we can only get attracted or do marrige from our opposite sex person. So a big misconception is cleared here that homosexuality comes from our ancestor's genes. Earlier there was a hypothesis by a scientist who said that it may be genetic but later on it was discovered that the scientist himself was a gay(psychologically not genetically). When people break the laws of nature(like having sex with multiple persons of their opposite sex) their mind later gets diverted to people of their own gender(like in western countries earlier, there were so called mistresses 10 or 15 for a single man) who fulfill the needs of wives for him alone. So, its our fault that we had multiple relationships which made us psychologically so ill that we started getting intrest in our own gender people also. God never made us like this nor he will. We are breaking the rules of nature. It is also scientically proven that having a single partner and enjoying a sex life with him/her throughout your life rather than being a playboy or playgirl(sorry for the words) make us a better human being in terms of both gender and obeying God's commandments. So homosexuality is a sin in almost every religion and we should not legal it in India. We should teach our future generations to have respect for their opposite gender person(especially to boys) so that they do not develop a mindset that girls are made for having fun(this will harm that boy psychologically later), he may start finding intrest in his male friends just to complete his fantasies. Same apply for girls. We should get bounded to the rules made by nature and find a single life partner for us whom we can persue our sexual and spiritual life. At last I would complete my stand by saying that God says us to follow the Truth rather than to follow people who speak that homosexuality should be legal in India on behalf of their democracy. Nothing is bigger than the Nature given laws and the Truth of life. Peace ✌

1813	NGEN	a	Pratik bahi... Great review as usual... Watch REVA gujarati movie which depicted Indian culture very beautifully... This movie is one of the best
1814	NGEN	a	we are so lucky to have our own country. Allah ka shukar hai we had a great leader like Quaid e azam who foreseen this. I live in UK at the moment my Indian friends always used to ask me why Pakistan was created? and if there was no partition of India we could be super power. Now i tell them this is the reason why Pakistan was created. Pakistan zindabad! Pakistan ka matlab kya la ilaha illallah!Pakistan zindabad!

1820	GEN	a	But doesn't Arundhati Roy looks like a dog, barks like a dog and acts like a dog? So isn't it obvious that she wants to be a kung fu dog and so advises people to call themselves one?
1821	NGEN	a	True lol dude
1822	NGEN	a	If Arundhati Roy is living in USA, then she should say the similar things about the actions taken by President Trump over there and see the reactions in the USA media about it rather than speaking such kind of foul words about the actions taken by the Modi government in India.
1823	NGEN	a	N drugged operation

1829	NGEN	a	I congratulate the brave husband for taking such a brave act. I am also the victim of 498a. I cant take this step for the sake of my son who is under her unlawful custody. Since one and half year I am suffering from this agony. I will fight till the end but not compromise.
1830	NGEN	a	"I want to ask Singer like Sona Mohapatra But tell me one thing, when u sang ""bedardi raja zara paas to aaja"" ...were u singing lulaby? What were u promoting? I liked the song, nice voice nice beats.. that's it. U must have put your best to sing the song. And remember ur husband, Mr. Ram Sampath creating music for Delhi Belly...rember the "" Bhaag Dk bose"" song. What was he promoting? Shahid Kapoor has acted brilliantly. Praise his acting skills the same way u took the accolades for ur song. Going by your logic, people who watched 'Gangs of Wasseypur'..they must have gone on a killing spree...using filthy language.. smoking weed..."
1831	NGEN	a	Such a great video shwetabhbhai keep making this kind of videos,i hope this video gonna viral so, people could understand what's the reality

1890	NGEN	a	Arnab is anchor or from BJP. More loyal to the king than the king himself.
1891	NGEN	a	I totally agree on all the points highlighted by u sir, but i would like to add a point. According to me the movie exhibits why one shouldn't be like kabir. It unveils how a person looses everything he loves just bcoz of his attitude and reverts only after slight improvement in hid attitude
1892	NGEN	a	Cheap video
1893	NGEN	a	Great video😘😘😘
1894	NGEN	a	Salute bhai

1916	NGEN	a	Arujdati Roy is a cocaine addict . she's only doing it for money to buy more , because she ran outta money . such a pity.. take her to deaddiction centre .
1917	NGEN	a	indeed shwetabh as u said its been over 30 years bollywood industry is not doing well , i watch only biopics and yes the movie Dosti (1964) used to watch many times that theme should be directed today having meaningful songs.
1918	NGEN	a	Bollywood and indian emotions are worst. What we do in relationship is not love it is chutiyapanti
1919	NGEN	a	Wow Good
1920	NGEN	a	Ramola is there
1921	GEN	a	PHOENIX- FROM NOW EVERY FEMALE WILL BE LESBIAN AND EVERY MALE WILL BE GAY.

NO SEXUAL CRIME LIKE RAPE OR IVTIZING WILL OCCUR IN THIS NEWEST SYSTEM... I WISH ALL THE BEST TO EVERY PERSON OF THIS PLANET.

1925	NGEN	a	So very nice
1926	NGEN	a	"In debates like this please keep only one mike ""on"" at a time say for one minute each time. This man Chetan is not allowing Madhu Kishwar to speak. If many people talk simultaneously the viewers cannot make out who is talking what. I watched it for only for a few minutes & I want to close it. There is no purpose in watching such cacophony anymore."
1927	NGEN	a	I like it ur video is very good Thanq for all ur team 😊
1928	NGEN	a	Thankyou bhai

1934	NGEN	a	How arundhati is in India who sent her here...she will not come of her own means some leftist funded her and she landed here to creat nuesence in India. Why she is openly moving to misguide the people of india.
1935	NGEN	a	thanks to making this video lesson supporter
1936	GEN	a	As long as people are listening, cheering and clapping for her. Things won't change because it's the mentality that's the problem. You put her in jail. One of her followers will replace her. It's a deep rooted problem.
1937	NGEN	a	Yes, 170,000 husbands have succumbed to Domestic Violence in 12 years with a yearly average of 14,166 and yet the Govt. and the society are not only silent about it but also silently laughing at it. Do our men deserve such a treatment? Do we not need men's welfare ministry?
1938	NGEN	a	[6:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ZMfQMZos0&t=6m40s) please suggest some names from the remaining 20%-30%..
1939	NGEN	a	Outstanding
1940	GEN	a	how do u tolerate those bastards who thought that homosexuality is like a disease and it comes from western country?? I felt like slapping them ... Still we are so ignorant that we don't know that reason behind being a homosexual. Great works guys, waiting for the reactions from other metro cities like Mumbai, Kolkata, Bangalore and others..
1941	NGEN	a	Just feminist bro, Not liberals :)
1942	NGEN	a	[2:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dctvge09P4A&t=2m42s) aita best chilo😁😁😁
1943	NGEN	a	Not comparing but even nice movies like Na peru Surya na illu India will hurt feminists for showing so called toxic masculinity.A man facing the problem with anger management = toxic masculinity.Since when? Do they want all the men to become effeminate.Feminists hate logic and reasoning for sure.Thats y I stay away from females and I have no remorse for it. Waiting for SJWs to get involved in keyboard war by replying me with some shaming language.I won't retaliate.😜👍
1944	NGEN	a	Wow
1945	NGEN	a	funny !
1946	NGEN	a	[6:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7ssviyHAe0&t=6m18s) best feeling

1949	NGEN	a	I can see Andh Bhakt here.. Keep it up.. 😂
1950	NGEN	a	@Herbert Paul constitution doesn't give freedom to unlimited FOE and treason. First read the constitution then comment.
1951	NGEN	a	If any girl will meet any boyfriend for first time she will never let that boy to kiss her on first time like Preeti......
1952	GEN	a	ARNAB IS NOT EVEN WORTHY TO BE CALLED A KUTTA!!!! ITS AN INSULT TO A DOG!!!!!!

1956	NGEN	a	Dialogue of girl was best.💜💜💖
1957	NGEN	a	throw her in jail
1958	NGEN	a	Exactly 👍👍👍
1959	NGEN	a	I watched it yesterday and frankly speaking I didn't like it much. And let me clear I am not feminist. Actually strongly hate fake feminism. Hero heroine love each other, but the family don't want them to marry, heroine forced to marry someone else, hero turns devdas and finally in the and they met, live happily. The storyline is now cliche and outdated but the makers of the film added rage, kissing scenes, lots of alcohol and stereotype ending. Nothing new.
1960	NGEN	a	Awesome
1961	NGEN	a	Honest
1962	NGEN	a	Very nice boos
1963	NGEN	a	Explanation level = Pro❤️💙
1964	NGEN	a	Nice via
1965	GEN	a	Brother, one more question : Why do u think being homosexual or gay or lesbian is not wrong ... is it because of their disabilities, or because of their choice or something else.
1966	GEN	a	Being straight is a choice then
1967	NGEN	a	Only waiting for this
1968	NGEN	a	Can you pls review some Pakistani dramas or movies?
1969	NGEN	a	Will checkout thanks
1970	NGEN	a	Crap programme. Why not Arnab control the speakers? Give each one few minutes and mute others? All speaking at the same time and which no one understands in a so called debate(😳) is his and many other tv anchors speciality . Plus the annoying flashing lights and banners running across the screen. Unprofessional to the core. I stopped watching after 10 minutes.
1971	NGEN	a	<https://youtu.be/UluJEnq8JCg> Hey guys I have a video about aspects on Kabir Singh, already 1 month ago kindly test my aspect also....your participation z appreciable 🌍 ❤️🇮🇳
1972	NGEN	a	"Watch Shahid replying to a typical feminazi while movie promotion <https://youtu.be/mOtBYdQMR0A> ""If i start justifying character i cant be an actor . I have to play characters for their good and bad. I have to represent them honestly thats what acting is about. Otherwise Im just wanting people to like me thats what stardom is about. Acting is about being honest letting people hate you sometimes and its ok its important"""
1973	NGEN	a	Rajdeep ji is her lighter version
1974	NGEN	a	Are u a Movie reviewer ?? Or social activist ??? Pls review Movie keeping your political and social agenda aside
1975	NGEN	a	I don't think the hero is an escapist , He faces the court and tell truth. He accepts his deeds and faces the punishment. He moved on and give up his bad habits after his grandmother's death but not for the girl.
1976	NGEN	a	Let the fools be bro. They only enjoy porn like Veere Di Wedding and brand it feminism
1977	NGEN	a	Ad kya ?? Ad-homo ?? Ad-homobakchodian ??
1978	NGEN	a	Kasturi is making a fool of herself....Roy not exhibiting freedom of speech , but asking people to lie .. like that ...duty free accent
1979	NGEN	a	@Jatin Singh Yadav please stop being obsessed about Hollywood and respect if someone has done something great. Don't insert unnecessary agenda of Nationalism.
1980	NGEN	a	we would love to hear
1981	NGEN	a	People like Arundhuti Roy should be deported to Pacific Ocean
1982	NGEN	a	Thanks for punishment
1983	GEN	a	Ranu is fucker frod
1984	NGEN	a	Bahi I respect you but the writer of the movie is not a bewakoof or chutiya, the story is real about Sandeep waga reeady sir and he is doctor to show his story in Bollywood he need to show that type of thing because in Bollywood
1985	NGEN	a	They only want to gain some fucking views remember tere naam scene in which criminal salman khan convince his love by kidnapping heroine no one did even mention about that scene.
1986	NGEN	a	Felt sad after hearing ur review.. Wen u becm a father n hv a daughter wll u speak d same thing u do nw... Means beating or slapping a girl... Being violent n forcibly kissing a girl without consent is dis right... U r d bad reviewer.. I m a mother n would never want my kid to suffer b it a girl or boy.. 90 percent Ppl clapped in pvr wen boy slapped a girl... Isn't dis influencing boys of tdys generation... U r always in favor of boys whether they r wrong or ryt.. U r always after n against girls...
1987	NGEN	a	@Kawaii Petrichor : when was the last time feminists did something for men?
1988	NGEN	a	Rajdip looks like Kamal Hassan Try in movie sir,😊😊😊😄
1989	NGEN	a	Preeti the dog has more dialogues and role than preeti the heroine. lol
1990	NGEN	a	Liberals are retards
1991	NGEN	a	@Om Parkesh Hello
1992	NGEN	a	I liked and agree with what you told in your video. I don't want to be offensive but as you said about this particular movie that this is Bollywood concept, you are totally wrong. This particular concept and storyline is taken from Telugu industry's movie Arjun reddy.
1993	NGEN	a	"I never thought i would see anything worse than Kabir Singh, but then I saw your video. So you think there is nothing wrong with dominating a young girl, without her consent? You think it is ok to tell every other person to not come near her because she is ""his""? You think it is ok to treat a girl like property? You also think it is ok to slap a girl when she is crying because her father saw you guys make out? Ye kahan ki mardaangi hai yaar? Open your eyes. Grow up. Do not promote self destructive and wrong behavior, especially to the huge population of impressionable kids who are your target audience, purely for likes."
1994	NGEN	a	Nicetipc
1995	NGEN	a	Plz stop misinterpreting public reaction. No body spoke against celebration of true love.. ppl spoke against how is it presented in that movie.. Ranjhna also showcased passionate love.. No body spoke against that... Libarism is the most inevitable upcoming change of society.. Other than bashing and being frustrated about it try to accept it...
1996	NGEN	a	Cheep Women ...

2000	NGEN	a	@Be Positive You are a Man-hater yourself. It is self-evident. I pity on the men around you.
2001	NGEN	a	Review kahan tha bhai isme entire video was just about the arguments regarding feminism... I was expecting your regular kind of review of the movie...and you make separate videos for such discussion. Don't get me wrong..I am your follower since starting but its my request make separate videos for review and opinions regarding other issues..
2002	NGEN	a	My bad I was wrong
2003	GEN	a	i guess simple girls r digging their graves, coz nobody likes dem😟

2005	NGEN	a	Vere nice video sir
2006	NGEN	a	Feminists​ and Liberals are curse to humanity
2007	NGEN	a	I support CAA and I appreciate Arnab for his efforts.... But for God's sake, this Nupur Sharma is an embarrassment. There is no need to comment on someone's accent and parrot on about something that's not related. It's basically heckling the other panelists. If the BJP is losing in different states, one of the reasons can be attributed to this attitude by buffoons like her. We shall win over these illiterate morons who haven't read the CAA. Rahul bhakts are just like their master. Expose them. CAA is needed for us.

2015	NGEN	a	@Debadutta Khandayatray Lol you are one of those people who are fed up with success of Narendra Modi despite your discomfort, Whole population of your kind is so ignorant and Hypocritical. You can have satisfaction that your comment got few likes, nothing more than that. Nothing going to change. You can cry shout yell 😂 but deep down inside you know that you are biggest loser.
2016	GEN	a	Good, ok homosexuality is legalised, but don't showcase in in by public, be normal like every other human being, if you have to do, go together in a room. But don't act like despo. In public it looks odd and ugly
2017	NGEN	a	Arnan we are big fans of you. You just blast these bigots, antinationals, some 4 or 5 people and now and then kasturi ( a Hindu name with Islam mentality) or some others who do not have answers when Hindus or Sikh girls being molested in Pakistan. You first talk of Hindus in Pakistan kasturi or durgandh

2029	NGEN	a	We need standalone kabir singh movie review
2030	NGEN	a	The main point of the movie was about a guy with anger issues who is unable to move on from someone whom he truly loved. They are separated because of the prevailing stereotypes. Sandeep Reddy Vanga has studied psychology himself, and he beautifully presented a story about a brilliant and intelligent surgeon’s downfall and his resurgence. The scene where he doesn’t want to plead not guilty because his professionalism is the only thing his father respected about him is very emotional and brings out the good nature of Kabir/Arjun. But liberals ko ye nahi dikhega. We live in a country where student life in college is shown in expensive cars, flashy dance numbers, with all the students looking like they just finished FHM or Maxim photoshoot but despise a film about a true and genuine love story!
2031	NGEN	a	Nice video... well done
2032	NGEN	a	Definitely
2033	GEN	a	There is nothing in this movie that can amaze any boy specially for girl this movie is may good ..coz after having so many x they finally want that some one new came & accept them with their dark secrets that y females are liking most this pethetic pies of shit ..and the respect of a female Dr vanish from a common man view !

2037	NGEN	a	Your opinion is mind blowing..No partiality, that is the good thing..👍👍
2038	GEN	a	No one is gay physically. They are mentally created by western

2041	NGEN	a	imo namber call me 008801850322634
2042	GEN	a	There are several shades of getting a gay or homosexual indictment to the the army which are highly solicitous about its rule and conduct and they even require it to maintain which is for the favor of nation. Frankly speaking if the person concerned has dedication for army and he may control his urges to not to impugn his conduct then it may be possible but chances are thin since it is not very easy to go along with the gender that he is supposedly attracted too.

2053	NGEN	a	Great review by [#prtikBrarode](http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23prtikBrarode) bhai You pointed Positive way Kabir singh
2054	NGEN	a	@Ankit Dass This controversy is not even needed. It's a story about a fictional character and let's just simply appreciate the hardwork they have put into it. The character undergoes a proper development and it is shaped well and has been put wonderfully by Shahid Kapoor. It's a journey of a Man dealing with consequences of lost love. It does not actually 'promote' anything. It's simply a story and its better to see a fiction as a fiction. I personally love both his and Sucharita's review but like I loved Sucharita's review on Mard ko dard nahi hota and I hated his review about Kedarnath. There's always a difference in perspective. This movie doesn't deserve the controversy it has been thrown into.
2055	NGEN	a	"There's a reason why actors are called as ""heroes"" In India. Idk what people are going to learn from such a terrible character."
2056	NGEN	a	Even your long sessions are interesting 👌

2089	NGEN	a	Sir....ur views and Lakshya Chaudhury's views matched.....Awesome...Sir.......I loved ur review and film as well
2090	NGEN	a	This review is more raw and more entertaining than the movie itself😂😂. Kash yea review 3 ghante ka hota
2091	NGEN	a	I'm agree with you bro.💪
2092	NGEN	a	Everything is good but bro how would you take if kabir Singh was a Muslim?? Just asking. This is gem of a movie I accept it
2093	NGEN	a	Omg 😅😅🤣
2094	NGEN	a	I was very curious about the way this film became so famous so thought of watching when it premiered in tv. I got bored by interval. I am really shocked how this movie was liked by so many people. I agree with you this movie is far from reality and this feminist arguments are also senseless. I didnt like it a bit ya seriously.
2095	NGEN	a	Absolutely right Man... Bollywood has fooled the generation...we are trapped and don't want to realise that Bollywood is a core objectification of men and especially women....and there chutiya launde, who are good for nothing but able to buy a movie tickets, dreaming themselves as Kabir Singh and want to replicate his actions in society.... I could not imagine what will happen when all youth turned to be kabir Singh as this is what movies want to show.. At the end, thank you a ton for making this video and I really appreciate your efforts to give some sense to the unguided youth....keep continuing your best work ...I want to see one billion/💯 crore subscription for mensutra....I am highly recommending your channel to my friends n family and to all youth....best of luck and lots of love...
2096	NGEN	a	But 99% liberals are praising this movie. Only so called feminists hv problems with this movie. Do not confuse ppl for ur agenda man.

2103	NGEN	a	It's a good idea to control population. People are doing sex because little pleasure is attached to it. Do something different for pleasure at the same time consiosly control population. Don't marry, enjoy the life you want it that's all matters.

2137	NGEN	a	Except political biased, i like his every review
2138	NGEN	a	I totally agree with u
2139	NGEN	a	I literally had an extended debate with a lot of people on insta who were defending the movie and the character, Kabir singh. We often forget that movies are very impactful. It's alright to make a movie on a disturbed, alcoholic and abuser man but to defend and sympathize with the character is wrong. Also, a lot of people got inspired by the toxic masculinity and I'm not just blaming boys but girls as well who constantly defended movies and characters like thess and saw no problem with how negatively it can impact our minds
2140	NGEN	a	Superb Review #$hwetabh bhai......👌👌👌👌👌👌
2141	NGEN	a	AND BETTER ......IF THESE PEOPLE DOESN'T PARTICIPATE IN POPULATION COUNT OF 2021. SO THAT THEY WILL THEMSELVES BECOME NON CITIZEN.

2148	NGEN	a	After so long. Finally satisfied with the Analysis of this shit movie. All this time these all thoughts were shouting in my head. The two parties both Radical male and female feminists had shit on this topic so much but didn't give any clear picture and impact. You earned my respect bro

2153	NGEN	a	"brutally on the men leaving them to fend for themselves on their own. Even the courts have an anti - men and a step - motherly attitude towards men what with the Honorable Delhi High Court observing, ""Though men are victims of violence, such incidences are few and far between, thus ruling out the possibility of protection from the parliament"", while dismissing a petition challenging the constitutionality of the Domestic Violence Act as it violates Article 14 of the Indian Constitution"

2174	NGEN	a	If People think court and police station can solve your problem then you have to develop extreme patience.. Else, incidents like this will be common. Noboy can bear the pain of a false 498a.., 52,000 men have committed sucide as per statistics. Its such cruel. Supreme court itself says that 498a is a legal terrorism.. i think this is one way the brave guy faught against terrorism

2234	NGEN	a	You are a hipocrit. There is a difference between feminism and feminizi. Please know the difference between them and then talk. You have certain mindset of howa woman should be and all, i just wanna say to men like u ,if u r nt Ram dont look for Seeta. Everyone has right to live the life they wont bt they Should nt be abusive and try to control othi just wnat k say -[#metoo](http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23metoo) movement was not only for women bt for all the victims be men or women against any culprit. If movies like veera di wedding is vulgar and absurd, all movies which glorifying male patriarchy, abusiveness, and drugs should be condemned too. Anything which glorifies wrong doing and promote such vile behaviour are vulgar coz they are worse and give wrong notion to the youth that being abusive and promoting control over someone is a right. Real men are wonderful, they never abuse woman for cheap publicity. I respect them truly.coz of them also women are getting opportunity and respect, but hipocrit men make of fun of them coz the cant competee with the real men

2238	NGEN	a	I agree with you on the movie Kabir Singh but to say only Indians copy what they see in movies and blaming Bollywood is wrong.Movies and shows have a great impact on society around the world.When 'The Exorcist' released in 1973,it had such a cultural impact.There is a documentary made on it.People flocked in theaters to watch that film only because it got word of mouth publicity for being the scariest movie of it's [time.It](http://time.it/) was banned in several places but people still took buses to watch the movie in the next town.The show 'Game Of Thrones', 'Breaking Bad' and 'Dexter' had a lot of impact on people.They have fan clubs for superhero movies.A lot of people were committing murders after watching 'Dexter' series.'Gone Girl' inspired a lot of people to commit similar crimes.'Titanic' had that same effect on people who were gushing over 'Jack & Rose' romance.K-Pop and K-drama has forced a lot of women around the world to believe in fairytale romance and they are all travelling to Korea to find a Korean bf/husband.Japanese manga and anime has a huge cultural impact on people around the [world.So](http://world.so/),I personally believe that you are being a little too harsh on Indians for loving Bollywood.Most Indians are middle class or lower middle class people who are struggling in their daily life.Sometimes reality is very harsh so they watch these over the top movies to escape their reality.I do agree that these cliched romance movies are very misleading and men and women both fall for these fake stories.
2239	NGEN	a	I cried when I watched the movies

2244	NGEN	a	Kasturi is backing lunatic AR saying Range and Billa to be Rajanikanth's super hit movies. It's not about Range and Billa it's about misleading and misguiding people to comment offences. 😑
2245	NGEN	a	Jghk
2246	NGEN	a	That's why i never watch bollywood movie
2247	NGEN	a	This nation is in pit of shit. Indian is the cesses pit capitol of the world. This view is not only my but is the view of most people’s view that stand outside of India and see what India really is. Indian woman wants to become like western woman but given the chance cant handle the freedom given which then end up in this kind of situation. God help man. Largest democracy in the world my ASS. I bet Indian woman don’t know the meaning of democracy.
2248	NGEN	a	You're watching the movie in a completely negative way. I get it that it does have a negative impact, but you're not giving a balanced analysis.

2253	NGEN	a	Dear Pratik, when i saw your movie review on Arjun Reddy, me and my wife saw Arjun Reddy. Till date its one of our fav. Movie. Accordingly we watched kabir singh and loved every bit of the movie. We felt bad when suchitra tyagi and rajeev masand gave bad reviews for the film. The sad part was they didnt understand the kabir singh or arjun’s reddy charecter. The points you mentioned in the review totally justify charecter’s intention. Nicely analysed.

Can't agree with you sorry....just think this person treats your daughter with the same abusive behaviour to show his masculinity & madness..it doesn't justify someone's illogical rudeness & forcefully making relationship bczz he wants that girl..woww...& U r saying is this really good?? U can't justify this character dear..bcz if u like ""KABUR SINGH "" Character then may b u also support the boyfriend/ husband who does domestic violence infct may b now u r starting to support the people who forcefully making relationship with girls bcz he likes her..really??? Today reaalllly surprised to see ur thoughts..U wr my favourite reviewer..but today u lost respect from me.If any girl will be in the same situation in real life in the college then That Kabir singh will be in the jail.. Worst movie..WORST CHARACTER IN BOLLYWOOD - KABIR SINGH.👎👎👎👎"

2268	NGEN	a	All what is happening within the parliament now with a majority on a religious lines is unconstitutional and should be stopped by whatever means. In a country with secular constitutuon you cannot let this happen and only way you can bring down the Modhi, Amit and Swamy clan is by civil disobedience.

2328	NGEN	a	Ranu mandal I just hate her
2329	NGEN	a	Totally agreed with your practicality but there are many subtle things that actually shows how bad the character is and how he suffers for that. You actually said a lot of things wrong: 1\. He understands how wrong his attitude is 2\. Looses his license even though he could have lied and won the case; this shows how the character matures and starts to remorse his attitude 3\. He is a kind of person who runs away from a complex situation but at the end he never wanted to bring that as an excuse (had it not been his friend, girl would have never known). He did wrong and he realised. 4\. Totally wrong when you say he is abusing his parents. The ending parts shows how his relation with father changed. 5\. Totally wrong when you say he used to stalk that girl even after breakup. He never does that even though he is unable to move on 6\. If u see the movie you will understand how he started hating himself. A man who is narcissistic by nature when he starts to be ashamed of his personality and attitude, its a very big positive change. 7\. Okay i agree he ends up getting the girl in a very unrealistic way, but the scene where he is ready to accept the baby and give him a father without anything spoken shows the purity in his love (i agree the ripening of the relationship was very bollywood typical though) 8\. yes agreed that he was self harming but nowhere did he let the girl know about it and hence force her to take any decisions based on that. The person is fake masculine i agree but not manipulative so you cant call it abusive relationship. 9\. This guy cares so much about the girl that he rubs her shoulder after removing her heavy bag. 10\. The girl had equal domination rights in him as well. She slaps him when he was out of control angry in a public place and he starts to apologise. I am sorry I do see a trait of matured and very mentally intimate relationship here. 11\. I agree his background was typical bollywood but again as you mentioned if he was not so pampered he would not have done all the blunders (a humble background would end up seeing him in jail and maybe a underworld don biography can be written after that), so to give the film all the colours he had to belong to a family of means. How about 50 shades of grey as an example ! 12\. Apparently he never reads(according to you) but how about the fact that he took her and taught her a lot during a song and never tried to take advantage of her (she made the first move which shows her agreement). Its also shown even though he tries to be masculine he never really could face the girl for long, he was not comfident till the girl agreed. 13\. You need to agree that girl enjoyed the character and hence he could be what is portrayed. And hence like kabir (which i do consider a realistic flawed person), preeti is also a very real character, silent but manipulative. 14\. Regarding that sex scene. Thats a typical example of rape. Many rapist actually raped when they were mentally unstabled adding physical needs (hormones) on top of that. But he says he is sorry and leaves (he dis wrong but he realises, isnt that good? Isnt that what a normal person should do?) 15\. He is tharki? Yes he is ... its his sadness mixed with hormones, a very typical situation of being desparate. But that same person never wanted to go into a fake relationship, isnt that honesty and maturity? He never wanted to hurt anyones feelings like his were hurt. All he wants is sex! Isnt that what hookup culture is in modern Metros? People hookup even without any mental desparation, just for fun. Why is that not a very real situation then? Please feel free to couter attack me with a debate. But till then your reviews are as flawed and biased as the charecter of kabir. Ps. I am a big fan of ur work and not a narcissist sympathizer. Dont worry man todays youth gets enough dose of dumb sexual contents. They are gullable. And sex sells, thats truth, hence is sold by bollywood. Kabir singh dint sell dumb sex atlst and is a masterpiece for acting skills. Maybe watch Vijaya dervakonda in arjun reddy. Takes a lot of effort to get in the shoes of those villain charecters, should appreciate that before calling it garbage. Ranvir was great actor since his charecter lost in padmavati but shahid is shit because his charecter finally gets love? Totally hypocrisy

2338	NGEN	a	Bro this movie is A Rated I don't think adults get influenced by movie so much unlike teenagers. Of course the character was a coward who always ran from his problems but that's okay.. not all lead character have to be perfect sanskari launda. Watch the movie for fun. There's no take home message from the movie. Dekh ke bhul jao. Apart from this I appreciate Shahid's acting. I also disagree with one of your point that he's medical student and you not see him studying. He is medical graduate and he is doing his internship for 1st half. Later he get admission in PG college there you see him studying when Preeti comes and surprises him. I like rest of your points. Great perspective. I Admire you

2348	NGEN	a	"It seems you didnt understand ""Kabir Singh"". Also, it looks like you lack basic knowledge to review a movie. Kabir Singh is a powerful movie. I know it has got its own faults but nevertheless a very raw movie. Also some points raised by you are valid where as others are just bullshit. We Indians like to watch stories of others, especially love stories. If you want to watch real stories then better stick to news channels,NGC,discovery and documentaries etc. Kabir Singh is an offbeat manic love story which you cudn't understand. Watch the movie once more you will get answers to your questions."

2357	NGEN	a	Mfs Saying Kabir Singh has toxic masculinity, where were you when Ranjhanaa was released, that Sonam slapped Dhanush unnecessarily isn't that toxic femininity, take Judaai for instance, sells Husband for money, is that ethical and good for a man coming from a woman
2358	NGEN	a	Bollywood also made great movies like super30, chhichhore, war. Better try to watch good movies instead of shitty housefull4
2359	NGEN	a	We all knew that the movie was a little over the top. The main issue was the selective outrage from the Feminist brigade. They critise certain movies that potray male lead characters as Dominant and vile. But at the same time they encourage toxic female behaviours in movies . Who treats her male counterparts as crap shit We somehow had to defend Kabir Singh There was no other way around
2360	NGEN	a	I crave for such intellectual conversations. God bless you sir.

2377	NGEN	a	"I think the first problem is Kabir Singh kind of neglects the negative aspects of his character and ultimately idolized him , if it ended in a tragic way and showed the results of his flawed actions , it could be called a ""Character Study"" . To say the truth Kabir Singh is an absolute idiot who has no control over his life. On the other hand movie like ""Taxi Driver"" actually exposes effect of loneliness , frustation of repressed masculinity , toxic outburst and most importantly effect of his actions i.e. his girlfriend leaves him and his attempt to commit suicide, moreover it's not shown as a love story."
2378	NGEN	a	Very nice 😂😂😂😂

2400	NGEN	a	Dear Sir: As much as we wish to understand the issues taken up on your channel, the simultaneous high-pitched voicing of cross comments makes it difficult for viewers like us to follow the main threads of the arguments. Please ensure that people talk one at a time? Looks like everybody wants their opinions broadcasted, irrespective of their relevance. Produces debates of very poor and laughable standards at the end of the day!

2415	NGEN	a	I suddenly remember why I don't watch these debates anymore, 20 minutes through and was bestowed with headache and irritation. Don't know about naming oneself Kung Fu Kutha but did hear a lot of barking and a lot less reasoning. Why can't my dear fellow Indians figure out a way to debate in a peaceful manner ? In fact, this suspiciously feels like intentional to throw the reason out in the ruckus. I once watched a debate between Bill Nye and Ken Ham about Evolution vs Creation and it is the most peaceful debate I've ever watched on such a sensitive topic. If they can do it why can't you dear fellow Indians (who are supposedly known for immense spiritual resources) ? This is shameful.

2472	NGEN	a	<https://youtu.be/oJPyhghdVTk> Please watch lakshay Chaudhary video On this 😆😆😆👍🏻
2473	NGEN	a	Bhai joker review please
2474	NGEN	a	Audience is not receptive to organic and unique contents regarding films in bollywood..that is why in this very era of mainstreamism, projects like bhavesh joshi,mard ko dard nahin hota etc. and many more (including Anurag Kashyap films) do not get the deserved recognition !
2475	NGEN	a	U r correct. Thanks for spreading the truth.👍
2476	NGEN	a	Even 150 crores look tough.
2477	GEN	a	Ranu Mandal is a bad and harami singer
2478	NGEN	a	Arnab can not take it truth
2479	NGEN	a	Finally, ABOUT FUCKING TIME
2480	NGEN	a	Waw... Acting amazing.. 👌
2481	NGEN	a	Very well explained प्रतीक भैया hatts off 👏👏😎
2482	NGEN	a	Sucharita from Not a movie review(you tube channel) and its viewers should watch this video.
2483	NGEN	a	She should be booked immediately under law action to be taken immediately to put her in jail
2484	NGEN	a	I am surprised Prateek that you liked Kabir Singh. A film where the protagonist does not respect women and thinks it is his birth right to choose a girl in his college and the girl should meekly surrender to his love in my case smacks of misogyny. It's not about liberals or intellectual. But the trailer itself puts me off that I didn't want to watch the movie. I would happily miss watching this movie because a man cannot behave like this. He cannot behave like he owns a woman.
2485	NGEN	a	Sir u r incredible....I would like to see you as a revolutionist ! Your work is unmatched .
2486	GEN	a	Homosexuals should never be allowed in the army.... It will damage the decorum of the army....
2487	NGEN	a	Put Arundhati behind bars and bann her.
2488	NGEN	a	A well explained review. Really loved it.
2489	NGEN	a	Oo osm.. 👭👭
2490	NGEN	a	She needs to be deported back to her adopted homeland -- Pakistan.
2491	NGEN	a	after 75 years of loot, someone is trying to do something good. it sems doing good for the country is unforgivable, specifically if its modi. who is this arundhati roy, what is she? what makes her think that she is an activist? shame shame.
2492	NGEN	a	Kick her out to pak
2493	NGEN	a	I love your critical thinking how you focus on details keep it up bro
2494	NGEN	a	Sir Do review of jersey movie

2512	GEN	a	Such a bitch.
2513	NGEN	a	Such good Hindi... Man really appreciate it.....
2514	NGEN	a	Eccentricity of bongs 😈.pak fan
2515	NGEN	a	This movie was ruined by its climax...It would have been way better if kabir comitted suicide because of depression or maybe would have moved on....Cause no one returns in such a relationship after the occurrence of so much of negative events...this could have been made a completely different and awesome movie if it would have ended up like the way i said....But the climax made the movie fucked up.. Hit like and reply if you agree

2549	NGEN	a	Stupid story 😑😡
2550	NGEN	a	Freedom of speech does not mean she'll provoke innocent people to come out and give them name of Ranga and Billa. I'm amazed who the foolish has given her the Booker Prize she's not worth it

2553	NGEN	a	Indian consititution say 📜📜📜📜📜 Leave 100 🕴 criminal but dont arrest 1 👤innocent
2554	NGEN	a	1 - no you are not.. he loves turly so he kissed her infront of family members in her home what is respectable man to love a women ! 2 - he accepted his ban Coz he knew if he will not so the drinking habbit will continue so it was a clever desion ! 3 - she slapped so right reason lefting her in someone else arms for night pleasure ..he could not get any information how she is ..& where is she ! 4 - one of the looser act it was she can't talk her family for own marriage again here Kabir is moron didn't send their family to convey if his family not agreed with this relationship so they both leave their home & got court marriage simple ! Feminists absolutely right !
2555	NGEN	a	Great analysis

2557	NGEN	a	send her to rehabilitation center
2558	NGEN	a	Vicary is really a good vicary.
2559	NGEN	a	<https://youtu.be/oJPyhghdVTk> watch sucharata roast
2560	NGEN	a	Yes sir its a good movie I watched it yesterday and shahid is mind blowing
2561	NGEN	a	Stop exargerating feminism . feminism is about protecting women in despair but of course u have to exergerate looking down upon its real goal to prove your point is just disgusting
2562	NGEN	a	U're great sir ... Today I have watched Kabir Singh ... I agree with you being a woman
2563	NGEN	a	@Truthshallsetyoufree WTF are you doing boss! You are commenting that someone will deal with your shit in a video of channel which says YOU ARE THE ULTIMATE BOSS. The YouTuber is trying to make these boys as ALPHA MALEs. And you are trying to make them stupid people. That too, by telling that some one will take thier sins!!!
2564	NGEN	a	True my friend
2565	NGEN	a	Thankx
2566	NGEN	a	I did not see the movie. I am proud of it. Stay away from flimsy propaganda. Focus on your career, parents, society and country. Rest all is illusion.
2567	NGEN	a	From today onward she will be called kungfu bitc?
2568	NGEN	a	U always talk same shit
2569	NGEN	a	Three people are speaking same time !!!
2570	NGEN	a	Nupur Sharma ruined the debate. Why isn’t Arnab reducing her volume, like he did for the Congress guy?😂 Rather at [18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3d5IlngAMA&t=18m04s) , Arnab says “Nupur , please common yaar”

2582	NGEN	a	Most awaited video 😂😂😂😂
2583	NGEN	a	If you see her face in morning then you can't get food in whole day.
2584	NGEN	a	Iam straight. Bt am really happy for u all, who r open minded about their sexuality. And congrats for ur victory...
2585	NGEN	a	One sided debate.. bullshit
2586	GEN	a	@Vidya Harish Bhandary She is a failed soft porn actress from the south
2587	NGEN	a	She is possibly back in money collection (mean free flow of foreign money for not doing any fruitful work like some of NGOs/ Rights organizations) mode because her lifestyle must be getting affected. She cannot do anything fruitful to earn money. So get into such acts of misleading so that her flambouyant style of living is not affected.Channels are there whose attempts are to build TRP around such persons
2588	NGEN	a	Arnab is no longer the same anchor he used to be, before Republic TV. I don't like watching him anymore, very bias news anchor.
2589	NGEN	a	@vipul bisht good for u!
2590	NGEN	a	Kabir Singh is biggest chutiya character Sattu Rajkumar Rao (Shadi main jaroor aana) is very motivational character
2591	NGEN	a	Arundathi roy has no right to live in India, if she instigates violence through through spreading her dangerous ideology. We Indians should not fall for these kind of TRAITORS. PLEASE BEWARE OF THESE KIND OF PEOPLE. SPREAD AWARENESS. WE NEED TO STOP THESE NON SENSE.

2634	NGEN	a	"I don't like movies like ""four more shots"", ""lust stories "" ""veere di wedding "".. infact these movies are drugs to the girls in my POV But i have a few questions against this movie as well.. Why did kabir warn the other boys to date her before asking her consent? What if she did not like him? What if she did like someone else !"

2645	GEN	a	Men and women are created for each other.Homosexuality is [wrong.It](http://wrong.it/) is considered a sin in many religions.Delhi is not the only place in the country.I am sure rest of the Indians dont support homosexuality.Those people in the video probably supported coz camera is ON!!Why did god create opposite gender for every living creature on earth?

2653	NGEN	a	Excellent Review Pratik
2654	NGEN	a	i hate it when one is unable to complete and is spoken over , cant understand both sides. there should be some sort of mute button, and warning cards, on debates like this.
2655	NGEN	a	Hmm okay
2656	NGEN	a	who says ,, kabir singh is a ' MASTERPIECE'. than what you think about these nonsense movies interstallar inception dangal bahubali
2657	NGEN	a	We the people should take law in our own hands to punish these traitors..we just can't depend on our judiciary , police and any political parties...... It's time to rebel against these anti national pigs and go the extent of eliminating them
2658	NGEN	a	damm that intro sounds good
2659	NGEN	a	These Maxist Urban Naxals should be Jailed
2660	NGEN	a	"@smart prabudh dixit the problem with ""Indians"" is that they are very emotional people. When a kid in his teens sees one of these so called ""romantic bollywood films"", it is bound to play with his mind. In this scenario, i certainly won't blame the directors or producers, because I'm sure they may have great scripts, but the audience in India is such that they dont want to see that. They don't support it, they dont like it. They want to see that typical ""mirchi masala"" movie and they dont want to think beyond that. In such a situation, the cinema industry has no option but to comply with them. I think its high time we open up our narrow thinking. I saw Joker yesterday, and oh boy was that a masterpiece. I find it hard to believe that we dont have such brilliant ideas, but bringing it to the big screens is the biggest problem. I can do nothing but hope that one day, bollywood moves on and gives a chance to better projects. Kudos!"

2665	NGEN	a	Jayaram Akkina I was about to write the same thing, imagine the same story written by someone who is from Bollywood director, then it would be considered cult classic I am not saying Arjun Reddy/Kabir Singh is cult, but it was far better than many movies called as hits.
2666	NGEN	a	Kasturi is another Arundati Roy. Both idiots
2667	NGEN	a	Holle

2672	NGEN	a	Shahid Kapoor has clearly said that this is a chutiya character. Its the chutiya audience which glorifies it.
2673	NGEN	a	Iam agree with you bro 💯
2674	NGEN	a	Awesome 😘
2675	NGEN	a	Nowadays these fake feminist's portrays women empowerment nothing but sex, alcohol, multiple partners ect ..... Instead of education , employment, social security and equality .... people like Sonam Kapoor, swara Bhaskar,sunny Leone are called feminist and women like Arundhathi bhattacharya , Indra nuee, tessi thamos , Mary kom , ect..are not even recognized as true empowered women ....
2676	NGEN	a	Yes correct. North india is the hell on earth. South India is heaven on earth. Proud to be a south Indian. Hate north india
2677	NGEN	a	I watched almost all your movie reviews and videos but in those movies you are saying smoking and drinking is the symbol of poor lifestyle and I agree that 200% but not here Why????
2678	NGEN	a	Nice t shirt
2679	NGEN	a	4 shots ,veere di wedding etc supports by feminists and liberals but not by you and movies like kabir singh/Arjun Reddy is supported by u but not by them..Actually both are wrong...those webseries shows sex, one night stand,masturbation,multiple partner as women empowerment which is completely wrong but here in Kabir singh Love is justified thing in movie but slapping a girl, being rebel ,womaniser ,highly alcoholic and pagalpan is also not good for indian audience to present because this movie may show only true love but in real life these love turns out to be acid attack/rape,owner killing and suicide in most cases . So, ideally both type of cinemas are not good to support. we are not learning or getting something from these kind of movies/webseries.

2697	NGEN	a	Hi pratik, usually i do not comment on youtube videos But i have been following u n watching ur videos for a long time Kuddos for making these videos Those who call themselves feminist are not feminist at all I'm sure that they do not even know the meaning of feminism One example is Sonam Kapoor, she says that she is a feminist, but do her movies portray and show the concept of feminism No, they do not ! The fact is they are the ones who are ruining the name of feminism and those who are really working for equality for both genders
2698	NGEN	a	Totally agree with you Pratik👍👍👍 I am also telling these things after watching this movie
2699	NGEN	a	Awsm video
2700	NGEN	a	Hollywood is more complicated. In late 80s and 90's female character in movies are represented as sex objects nothing more. Hollywood produce more volger movies. Even today American are not very much interested in frmale oriented movies that is why female centric flims fail meserabiliy at box office. Preeti character like character can be seen in Hollywood movie eg bella from twilight Anastasia from fifty shades of grey. These woman dont have standing character they often under the influence pf their male partners. Such girls do exist. Kabir singh movie became controversial in north only the audience in south had no problems with the movie. There are lot of movies released with more sexual assaults and violance than kabir singh then why everyone is after kabir singh. Movies don't encourage violence their are lot of violence happen in real world. Flim is a media that represents to the audience that this type of violence do occur. Person with mental issues behave violently even with the influence of movie. Blaming movie for mental issues is not right.

2720	NGEN	a	Movie thik he bas thodi lambi hogayi, 2 ghante me bhi dikha sakte the. Acting bhi achi he. Lekin lead character ke baare me jo criticism he, that doesn't make any sense. It is a movie and the character is a flawed one. How is that so hard to get? Some people have a hard time understanding context.
2721	NGEN	a	Arnab Goswami easily qualifies for top prize in presenting the worst programmes on T.V and is foolish enough to call them debate !
2722	NGEN	a	We all knew that the movie was a little over the top. The main issue was the selective outrage from the Feminist brigade. They critise and discourage certain movies that potray male lead characters as Dominant and vile. But at the same time they encourage toxic female behaviours in movies . Who treat Their male counterparts as DOG SHIT We somehow had to defend Kabir Singh There was no other way around

2771	NGEN	a	Yes nice
2772	NGEN	a	Kabir Singh aggressively chases his maid to assault her. Takes out his knife when the girl refuses to have sex with him. He also enters Preeti's classroom & announces in front of everyone that she is his property. Ye sab problematic behavior hai. Iss tarah ka behavior ko glorify karna ya phir just his anger issue keh ke pass off kar dena sahi nhi hai. Do you have any idea about extent of crime against women in India? These movies promote such asshole type entitled behavior & are in a way responsible for violence against women. So called liberals ki moral values ko judge karne se pehle khud ki values ko evaluate karo if you are okay with all these. There is a reason why India is one of the worse countries in the world for women. Think about it aur apne iss fake victimhood se bahar niklo.
2773	NGEN	a	very nice
2774	NGEN	a	Don't call rajdip you're batter journalist than him
2775	NGEN	a	@Filmy Deewane sometime I also disagree with pratik (eg. Raazi movie )but almost every time he is honest.. I follow pratik because he is honest and his reviews are unbiased.... We need more people like him, Vivek agnihotri, Anupam kher ji, sadhguru etc... These people are doing great by instilling indianism in fellow Indians. And yes entertainment always wins... No matter what librandus, fake feminists say.

2814	NGEN	a	What people don't realize is that if Kabir Singh made you feel uncomfortable, it was supposed to. It did exactly what it set out to do. With Arjun Reddy and now Kabir Singh, the director Sandeep Vanga is only exhibiting a different kind of genre by narrating the story from the perspective of a protagonist who's grossly flawed. For once we are shown the film through the prism of grey rather than the extremes of black or white. Because the story unfolds from his perspective, Kabir thinks he's the right kind of man, always in the right, wronged by circumstances and justifies his alcohol and substance abuse on the same basis, which is typical of any addict. Throughout the duration of the movie, he doesn't realize the fact that the fault lies solely with him. That it's his nature that's rotten, not his destiny. Throughout the film, we are shown his downward spiral into insanity, almost feeling a sense of suffocating hopelessness as though we too are infected by his self-inflicted agony. Vijay/Shahid both did a great job in conveying this torment in their respective renditions of the character. This misery continues till the very end, up to the point where we as an audience have given up any kind of hope of redemption for the protagonist, when he does a 360 degree turn by finally acknowledging his problem and sets out to seek salvation. I didn't find anything remotely wrong about this movie. The film doesn't in any way glorify the character. On the contrary it makes you feel disgusted and repulsed by him to the extent that you'd never even think of following his lifestyle. You'd completely abhor it. Personally, speaking from experience, as a person who's never had alcohol or consumed drugs or been a domineering misogynist for that matter, the film rather than giving me a wrong message instead made me all the more determined not to stray on to such a path. You literally end up begging the character to mend his ways. The supporting characters in the movie like Kabir's brother and his friends are all the while trying to draw him out of his ruination but to no avail. This film is in fact a very revolutionary step in Indian cinema, depicting a story about a flawed man, languishing in a greyish-dark space rather than lily-white or pitch- black. Usually our films don't go into that area. The film actually delivers a positive message that you can start redeeming yourself even when you touch the rock bottom of hell as long as you possess the will to do so. When Kabir is at his lowest point after being debarred from his profession and having suffered a personal tragedy, he is at the rock bottom of his pit and he has to make the choice whether he wants to remain confined to the darkness of the pit for eternity in a limbo or start climbing out of it. He does the latter and thus the film after subjecting us to a lot of darkness and discomfiture for most of its runtime leaves us with the teensiest glimmer of hope. Just like life. For all those who were unsettled and disturbed by the movie, as I said earlier, it was supposed to make you feel so. The superlative acting and technical expertise made the movie a worthwhile experience. I wish all these ultra-feminists and so-called liberals watch this movie with an open mind and learn to accept a posture distinct from their own. Especially since this breed cries hoarse when accusing the right wing of trying to distort history and current narratives to impose their points of view, when they are themselves intolerant to those of others. To deny that people like Arjun Reddy/Kabir Singh exist, would be denying the harsh reality of society. These are the same people who whoop and clap when Swara Bhaskar masturbates and abuses her husband on screen.

2825	GEN	a	BRO MOVIE IS MOVIE.SEE AT AS A MOVIE. AND WE ONLY LIKE THIS MOVIE BECAUSE THE ACTING OF SHAHID WAS VERY GOOD. And people atleast got to know that they should not self harm for anyone. And atleast some struggle was there in movie that how people get so disastrous after a break up. All girls are brainless creatures and Main story of every girl is they first start loving a fuck boi who dont respect her at all and when he ditch her,they openly say with their shitty mouth that all boys are same. Person who genuinly like krta h usse to vo banda intrest hi nhi marta. So in 14 -20 yr old nibbis and even nibbas are just mad.Stay away from relation ship in these years coz there are rarely anyone who who know their wants. Girls are mad.Stay away from them as much as possible.Dont follow them blindly.Let them do whatever they want coz they even themselves dont know what they want.They r fucking idiots.

But they too know him for a very long time and his friend wants to help him cause his friend wants the Hero to have a better life. Not just a dummy character like in other Bollywood movies. It's the bonding between the friends.

2839	NGEN	a	The Movie was crafted very cleverly and was a true entertainment... It just goes wrong where people start getting inspired by it. If this movie was according to Shwetabh it wouldn't have an entertainment factor (even though I agree with him). People come to watch hyper exaggerated movies. The only problem is they start relating stuff personally and getting motivated. This video is an eye-opener for such people... Great content Shwetabh!

Until a major audience and culture treat women equally. These characters must be abused in reviews

2888	NGEN	a	Really... You tried to analyze the cinematography of the movie Joker and so much sympathy on the character... if someone like a depressed person got inspired by this movie and kills a person then what?.... Stop this overaction and try to watch Kabir Singh from technical point of view like what u did for Joker.. don't give lectures on how the character should behave in the movie.. like Kabir took drugs and left Preeti so he is not responsible.. shut the F.. up . Sandeep Vanga is going to direct a crime movie.. prepare some points on how the characters should behave in that upcoming movie and send it to Sandeep... stupid...

Wow and confirmed all by yourself that all that rape allegations on army men are wrong ! I am not saying I'd it happened or not but wow mr_three_eyed_raven you confirmed it! Thanks
2901	NGEN	a	Dear Pratik, Not all feminists and liberals go to extreme measures like putting down men and humanising terrorists and what not. The cultural values you keep referring to are ruining women's and even men's lives in the whole world and especially in India. Need i mention dowry, domestic violence, rapes, false rape accusations, lgbtq rights, mard ko dard nahi hota crap? You just bashed two communities because of the behaviour of some of its members which is exactly what you accused them to do. You are a hypocrite. You are influencing a huge amount of people what you just did was spread hatred. Did you know feminist actually means the equality of the sexes not manhating as you said? As for the review if you call slapping each other, bashing your partner's family, not being able to confront you dad about forcing you into marriage with another guy after becoming an independent woman(a doctor!) , forcing a girl on knife point to show her body, drugs, smoking and drinking excessively because you cannot deal with a breakup, performing surgury while intoxicated a heroic romance then god bless you. God save you. Sincerely, A feminist

2928	NGEN	a	I'm not agree with you if we do like that kind of point of view with any movie and put those kind of inputs then we can say any film is bad ! For instance if I would talk about PK and I use your inputs so it will be a worst film for me ! ..

2945	NGEN	a	She should be immediately shott deadd !!!!
2946	NGEN	a	What about super 30?
2947	NGEN	a	Actually this movie is different because..in other Bollywood romantic movies hero fights with 100 villains for heroine..or heroine's father is the villain who hires a gang who will beat hero and then hero will fight and prove his love...kabir singh is at least different in this case...and Kabir singh is rude and short tempered..that's his fault and director portrayed the impact in movie..and the suffering is also portrayed..this movie does not influence boys to do whatever Kabir singh does...if anybody gets inspired..then he will be also inspired to kill people by only playing PUBG And one more thing it is at least better than those shitty Bollywood movies in which hero fights villains without any weapons(like he is superman).at least something is different from the previous Bollywood romantic movie trend.. please support that.and you are talking about the behaviour of a real human being is not portrayed? Who stays confused in his life? I think you have not seen the movie till the last minute..Kabir Singh who was rude from the first he also cries at a time when everything was going out of his hand..so it shows hero gained some lesson from his past and audience should take this as lesson from the movie. Humble request to you leave the review kind of things to film reviewers...movie analysis is their speciality

2998	NGEN	a	I’ve following you since then, but today I would like to ask. Were you speaking in the same way (gali galoch language) since very begging or Anurag Kashyap movies like Gangs of Wassepur has affected you bro? This is not acceptable that you teach us these communication etiquette that its cool to speak this way.
2999	NGEN	a	Very well done
3000	NGEN	a	Kabir Singh portrays the emotional high and lows of young love that is supplanted with physical attraction, anger, and indulgent behavior. The background music shows these. There is something called chemistry which plays a big role at first-look young love. Only the ending made no sense. I have known many Kabir Singh couples in college.
3001	NGEN	a	O nice
3002	GEN	a	No they should not be allowed as the institution about which it is talked about is a very auspicious institution, moreover army teaches the civilians to be disciplined and to do the right thing and homosexuality is a wrong thing moreover due to the homosexuality of a person he or she cannot meet the standards of Army and it will affect other soldiers too so they should never be allowed as many times it is seen that the homosexuals suffer from STDs so this wold harm the standards and reputation of Indian Army.....

3025	NGEN	a	I'm a big critic of modern form of feminism and agree on all your points in the video. Only thing i didn't like in Arjun Reddy (not watched kabir singh yet) is the way ragging is portrayed and shown as a tool to impress the girl.. she is not an object to be owned.. what if she didn't fall in love with Arjun??? What would be his reaction? May be he'd have ended his life or harmed her, she was shown as a submissive girl may be suffering from Stockholm syndrome, Jo bhi ho.. i am against such bullies. And on a side note i loved Arjun Reddy and have already booked tickets for Kabir Singh.. hope you reply to my comment Pratik.. Jai Hind.. Bharat Mata ki Jai..

Law system is needed to be amended, otherwise every new born in India can be called a cursed child because system. You never know that kid may suffer due to Legal Terrorism. America has given the guidelines to its citizens(NRI) that beware of certain things when you are going to India. Look this is called Human Respect.

In a society where patriarchal values r deep rooted & most of the young males r brought up with a sense of superiority, their ideas about the female psyche r already warped, plus most guys don't have first hand experience at interacting with girls. Where do they learn from then? Movies r one of these sources. Tell me, if u were the girl on the receiving end of unwanted & obsessive love, would u accept it just because the guy is crazy about u? I'm not saying Kabir singh is a bad movie, I'm saying that not everyone would take the right message from it.

3122	NGEN	a	I'm not Trying to be Feminist or So-called Liberal but Cinema influence Youth... I don't say dark character should not be shown in movies but showing its consequences is necessary too... The problem with kabir singh is not with the negativity of the character, but with the people buying into the negativity. People are proclaiming him the HERO and is glorifying him as an inspiration! Kabir treated Peeeti as his Toy, his 'Bandi'. Kabir at no point asks preeti for her consent regarding his forcing her to be into relationship with him, which can mislead many men too, even lots of girls will find it cute too.. Imagine a Kabir Singh in your Life!!! My Problem is not with the movie or character but the character is so real that it can lead to birth of so many Kabir Singh in real life which is regressive to the society.. The character is celebrated as a romantic lead which is dangerous if subjected to real life, people are finding his actions , his abuse, hus anger cool.. his negativity is celebrated but thats really wrong.. his character is so real that it can provoke men in our country... Kabir Singh is a masterpiece, Acting is Fabulous, but In reality I don't support such person, but today's youth especially boys will consider this cool & heroic which is a threat.. Also if you guys have any problem with my opinion... Watch the episode of 'Satyamev Jayate' on Masculinity... maybe it may open your eyes.

Personally I thought this to be full of cringiness and boredom, I wanted to leave the theatre at interval but sat there expecting some kind of twist or turn which never came. Nothing new for us 90s kids who suffered similar kind of torture before and have to see them for god knows how many years😪😪

3160	NGEN	a	@Ruchi Sapehia truly said. Condition is very fragile in such places. I have been there. People there are not only uneducated but also try to replicate age old religious dogmas over the meek and weak people. They just want to make sure that they are the ones to be respected out of fear. It is just that such movies boost up there moral because the hero does end up with a nice girl 😅. So just a little bit worried on this part.
3161	NGEN	a	Kabir Singh is a shit in the name of a movie.... There is nothing in the movie expect shity Bollywood spice.... Thinkers can't even tolerate to watch it.... That's it.... Khatam bat....

3165	GEN	a	this girl should be raped!
3166	NGEN	a	If women is shown having sexual relations then its a problem for u. Then that is fake faminism. But if kabir singh is shown as womeniser then it is a very good movie. If a women is shown drinking then it is very bad and against cultural values but if kabir singh is shown as a drinker and smoker then we should be proud of the movie. Kabir singh is threatening everybody that preeti is my lady, nobody should come close to her and thats a morally right thing acc. to you. Wow, what hypocrisy. I know the movie is about negative side of kabir singh but unfortunately this side of kabir singh has been highlighted in a very stylished misogynistic way. In this film one thing is clearly shown that women should like and look for dominating and possessive lovers. If same role will be based on a women then u will obviously have problems, you will see it as a unculturable and non traditional thing. Why women should always be shown in submissive roles. 99% of movies in india are based on male point of view but if 1% of movies are based on female point of view, their liberties, why everybody has problem in that. This is true hypocrisy. Atlast i want to say.. this is purely my opinion and point of view. You may not agree with me and let it be. But please atleast think about it.
3167	NGEN	a	this was very realistic video sir 🙏

3241	NGEN	a	"Bro you should watch that movie again just to clear some facts. When Kabir meets Preeti in the end, she tells her about her residence in some hostel and she worked in a clinic. Movies are not always meant to connect them with reality and teach us lessons ( I admit some movies do that). Some are meant to enjoy. The movie shows an excellent chemistry between two guys with some mind blowing romantic songs, how much more do you expect from it bro? Nothing is perfect bro. As you said person should ideally move on immediately after break up (in one of the videos you said in a slang way that, “khat khat move on karna chahiye mard ko""), I am with you bro. But it would take 3-4 months for a guy and it’s normal. Kabir Singh here takes his time say 7-8months (not too much for even a fictional story), and then they marry. He developed smoking and drinking habit but even in that time he worked. Yeah one thing you exaggerated about medical students (they didn’t get time of all this). I being a medico can say that we get time for our relationships and we also live as a social animal. (I am not proving you wrong but you just exaggerated the fact)."

3277	NGEN	a	Simple & genuine explanation. As it should be...taken by everyone(male or female). My question here is : people in real life also do that sort of escapism . .when responsibility or stress is onto them..like men do overdrinking, drugs. Or kind of abuse you were telling about. Women run away with their choice, cut their vein.. So..are these not the signs to say enough about the person...and what should we do for them if we can't leave that relationship (like he/she be my sibling with such behaviour)

3292	NGEN	a	@Nitya SG the director here too doesn't talk about that intentions but having no restrictions with loved ones that's it & its true isn't it? Where's love if there r restrictions so yeah I don't think he is off here & neither in movie is there a single domestic violence issue & yeah whatever I do its not out of rage or with the intent of wanting to rip them off so its fair
3293	NGEN	a	This is a publicity stunt. This person was in hibernation for sometime. This speech is nothing but sedition. She is unfit to live in this country. The action by Govt against this speech should be severe. It will be a deterrent for other anti-national forces.

3315	NGEN	a	Yes you don’t appreciate but that is the story. Movies cannot be about a perfect guy and a perfect girl. There has to be weaknesses, goodness, villain, climax all this make a good movie. Otherwise who would want to see a normal life. These are stories about broken man who is mad and that is his character which Shahid played so well. His madness was the reason she stayed away from him. She forgave him when she slapped him like 5 times.

3360	NGEN	a	Arundhati Roy's comments are based on contradictory statement made by Prime Minister and his Home Minister. Sourabh, Ms. Roy is neither Prime Minister of India nor Home Minister. People of this country are loosing their faith in this Modi government since their decision are based on creating confusion in our lives. In case, you are a true journalist, you should ask questions to the people sitting on the highest position such as PM, HM or CM of UP who has no faith in democratical value of the constitution.

3384	NGEN	a	Forget the feministic point of view. .this movie has got nothing in it. .it was just a random sequence of scenes made into a movie. .no logic no continuity. .all characters were capricious. .i have never seen a drug addict get rid of his addiction within a day without the help of a rehab. .i have never seen a girl so muted n submissive to fall in love literally without a reason. .every character in the movie was far from imaginable. .i think all the people who went to watch this movie have been befooled by the trailer of this movie. .those who havent gone yet please save your money and watch the world cup instead or go to an amusement park with their families for an outing. .i give this illogical movie a big fat zero out of any positive integer. .

3387	GEN	a	"In Indian army.... I will say in any army of the world the backbone, the foundation of military or army is ""Discipline, Honour, Valour, love for Motherland and Humanity, Courage to accomplish impossible task and many more hard works""..... These are the things which is foundation of Indian armed forces or foundation of any best militaries around the world, talking about Gays or lesbians..... Just look at history in ancient time very few or negligible number of women take part in army but time changed we are in 2019 and women are serving in military so Now Gays and lesbians recruitment in military then military is well aware about the developments to be done according to need and time and I think in future military will induct Gays and lesbians in armed forces but now Indian army chief said we will not allow Gays and lesbians in army then he is 100% correct and I support army chief, patriotism is not just needed on borders for military only but inside the country also we need a lot of patriots for bright future of country."

3442	NGEN	a	"I didn't watch that Kabir Singh movie. But I watched telugu version Arjun Ready. Reluctantly I agree with Shwetabh ,but in ""Arjun Ready"" hero will move on, give up his bad habits after his grandmother's death and not for that girl. Though he has bad habits, I felt his character was genuine. He didn't not want to escape from punishment or Karma for his deeds. He agrees his crime in the court. He didn't not want to escape like a coward. And lastly he knew that he is wrong. He knew that, this is a phase in his Life. He knew he is going to be changed and want to change but can't because he is addicted. Sincerely I didn't like Shwetabh's point of view for the first time. May they changed story line because of Bollywood's pressure."

3449	NGEN	a	Md Shahin right
3450	NGEN	a	Before the advent of internet, social media n videos sharing platforms people like arundhati were seen as elite writers, liberal and intellectual bt time n internet has broken their charm n it has shown that they r nothing but rabid haters of india, supporters of anything that is against india.

3488	NGEN	a	Saurabh Dwivedi is behind the lustre of Rajdeep Sardesai who has swayed his pitch black clouds in the Lallantop, in place of impartial they r becoming leftist n partial. Rajdeep is a blot on journalism, coz a journalist must be transparent n partial. Thought can be, for a journalist is a human being. But, the thought should not affect ur profession. I'm a teacher who tries his best to respect the profession. Rohit Sardana, Shweta Singh, Pratik Chaturvedi, Rajat Sharma n News Channels (not always) NDTV(Never) etc r exemplary.

3629	NGEN	a	Why do you give any credence to Roy? Make her irrelevant by not inviting her to your shows. You are also in colpable if you invite rotten characters on your program. She is relavant because of your channel.

3642	NGEN	a	Thanks 4 the video ✌✌✌
3643	NGEN	a	All those feminists who are criticising the film did not understand at all the meaning of the film. Nowhere did the director tried to justify Kabir Singh or tried to portray him as a great human being. It's the story of a flawed character, his downfall to the path of self destruction and final redemption. Actually for me it's quite an inspiring story. We all have inner flaws and demons within us and are constantly fighting with them. Kabir Singh became a victim of his inner demons which led to his downfall. But its inspiring to see his final redemption after controlling all his inner demons. So I request all feminists to have some basic knowledge about films before trying to criticize. They should watch the Oscar Winning film of Robert de Niro 'Raging Bull' before judging Kabir Singh. As usual a fantastic video by you Pratik ji and by your sound reasoning u have given a tight slap on the face of all these feminists.
3644	NGEN	a	@Rajender ji12ewcgsdffeewandal can yu call me dear on 7045495339, im in muumbai
3645	NGEN	a	Krishan K. Singh in this movie his character was not at all promoted. His father stopped speaking to him, grandmother didn’t want to see him this way. Only his friend and brother wanted to save him from his distructive life. Hospital was against him and he took responsibility for his drinking and told the truth so I don’t know what you mean by promoting his behavior. This a movie and it is different types of character in the world and that’s what they are trying to show. Story of a broken man that needs saving. In the end he takes responsibility.

3653	NGEN	a	@Vikram Matthews agree
3654	NGEN	a	Please share your opinion fight club and dark Knight quotes.
3655	NGEN	a	The contemporary feminist lives such a comfortable life that she has the time to complain about such trivial nonsense like manspreading and movie characters being a little too masculine. And if she wanted to, she would make a video about the movie, degrade it to the point that people would stop watching it not caring about the hard work the creators put for it and a female host of her channel would laugh about it and so would their audience. But I’m the one who is sexist if I complain about it because according to feminist theory, I’m privileged and the power structure gives advantages to men. What advantages? They can’t say. And because of this power structure, sexism towards men doesn’t exist. According to feminism, I am so privileged that I don’t even have the right to talk about gender issues. All of my opinions are automatically invalid because I’m a man. I am a man – I am evil, I am disposable, I am privileged. The thing is, I actually do care about gender equality. I would gladly point out real sexism when I see it being done against women, something which the new wave feminists bafflingly neglect to do when it’s being perpetuated by anyone. But feminists don’t return the favour. Their narrative is that I am the cause of all the world’s problems and I have to be the one to change, to make sacrifices and give more and more to them because of this imaginary bogeyman called the “Patriarchy” which they claim gives me all the systemic advantages in society. The concept of a patriarchy is essential to their ideology and this core makes the ideology paint me as the oppressor and the villain and I’m sick of it. I’m not a catcaller, I’m not a wife beater, and I’m not a rapist. But I’m held accountable for the actions of the few men who do these things and that’s bullshit. And it’s exactly the type of bullshit being perpetuated by several social media sites and YouTube channels - the idea that men are the problem, that we should be ashamed of what we are and that masculinity is toxic and needs to be stamped out. Feminist may claim that they don’t hate men but actions speak louder than words. If you call yourself a feminist but if you agree that all of the things that I talked about are wrong, then you need to stop calling yourself a feminist. You don’t need to call yourself a feminist to be an advocate for equality. Feminism doesn’t hold a monopoly on that as much as they like to think they do. And if you truly value equality, you will drop the feminist label and stop trying to defend it because it is – destructive, divisive, counter-intuitive, and predicated on lies and misinformation. Feminism is bullshit and it is unworthy of respect.

3658	NGEN	a	Film rating should be 7.4/10 Now, coming to pros - 1) Shahid Kapoor's acting. 2) Kabir Singh character personification. 3) Songs Cons - 1) No need to say about scenes. 2) Kiara's acting 3) Alcoholic... Overall this was a nice movie and one of the best in 2019.
3659	NGEN	a	nice movi
3660	NGEN	a	@Shashank Singh then by that same logic films like lipstick under borkha or veer de weeding also should not be made.. right .. coz it promotes misndric attitude among woman. ..

3690	NGEN	a	@Subhra Halder tech talk
3691	NGEN	a	Writing this comment at [8:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ZMfQMZos0&t=8m36s) so I don't know if you'll say what I want to say but I can't stop myself commenting this that the dashing and attractive look of shahid is shown in the movie which makes youth think that they'll still manage to have that attractiveness ( Thick looking beard, good hairs, those muscles and overall personality) in them even after abusing drugs is so fake. And in reality if people start abusing drugs than they'll become so unattractive bcoz reality will slap them so hardly and those drugs would make you go bald, loose those muscles, loose ur charm, loose ur social life, make you a failure in ur career and you won't even get that respect as Kabir singh got in the movie) Follow shahid kapoor not Kabir singh and to add to this statement I've to say Shahid kapoor went to gym and was on good diet for the role of Kabir singh so understand the difference of reel life and real life of the actors

3735	NGEN	a	true feminist is Cancer
3736	NGEN	a	Good action
3737	NGEN	a	Mr Kabir Fan stop glorifying and confusing anger and physical agression as love . A movie Showing 5% of repentance and 90% of aggression directly instigates negative behaviour. You will get your answer by viewing the audience of the film. It's not Feminism but humanism. This is clear chauvinism.
3738	NGEN	a	Of course she is afraid of showing documents that people will know that she is Suzanne and not Arundhati. It's like story of cat who lost its tail and preaching other cats to cut their tails. (People who bark that she is not Suzanne ask her to show her documents 😛)
3739	NGEN	a	You saved my dude bro😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣
3740	NGEN	a	She love veere di vedding 😂
3741	NGEN	a	"The entire point of sexually provocative songs (""item songs"" you know) is to grab in cash, sell albums and official tracks, get people to invest their times under the tag ""entertainment"", also they milk out quite a lot of money by selling it on iTunes, Google Music etc and most consumers of these songs are male audience. These cringy songs consume about half an hour of the entire movie runtime and rendition, Most times these songs don't fit the themes of the original movie i.e. Main Character belonging to a middle cast family going to an expensive bar and drinking like a water fountain, dancing with a girl in revealing clothes"
3742	NGEN	a	These movies are influencing all of teenagers (even age<16)(they saw movie by jugaad) In my hostel(in kota) kabir singh has became an ideal for all 11th and 12th students

3773	NGEN	a	"I'm not a feminist... I hate Lust Stories, 4 more shots please,De de pyar de,Veere do Wedding...n so many. I also hate Extra Marital, Pre Marital Sex. but I really disappointed with that scene 1.When her father sees them on the terrace. 2.When she tells their parents that they have done it so many times. 3.When he explains his Father that they were is their so called ""PRIVATE SPACE"". We are not supposed to do such things in front of our parents not Girls or Boys... it is same for everyone."
3774	NGEN	a	who all want Shwetabh Gangwar to make a movie? 🙌
3775	NGEN	a	awesome ...
3776	NGEN	a	I don't understand how that scene comes under rape, that girl inspite of being engaged and having a fiance persuades kabir from the hospital and ask him to come to her apartment to have sex and when he comes and they gets intimate her fiance shows up at the door, she freaks out that they might get caught and asks him to leave then kabir becomes a little irritated and acts aggressive in that moment but instantly realises it and walks off. How this is rape?
3777	NGEN	a	I saw the movie last week with my family and considered it a complete waste of my time. The movie had no story, the acting was horrendous, and in the end it promoted a negative message that your can completely destroy your life for one person and still come out a winner. Utter bakwas. I give it 1/10 at best.

3813	NGEN	a	@Soumik Chk 🙏🙏
3814	NGEN	a	I completely agree with your viewpoint. But look at this from another perspective, the normal human character that we are discussing in the video, it's basically the life that we are living, what these movies are based upon the saying is 'the grass is always greener on the other side' so in 2-2.5 hours in which a person is paying money to get entertained, he wants to take a break from his current life and now if this break is in some sort of fantasy-fabicated-reality then there is nothing wrong in it.
3815	GEN	a	We will not going to show any documents to govt.. We will see what they can do.. The motherf**ker BJP ?
3816	NGEN	a	I truly agree with you brother. Btw intro was awesome.

3908	NGEN	a	sotti great roasted i have ever seen
3909	NGEN	a	Everything you said is accurate and 100% correct except we Indians still haven’t developed as a society where people can genuinely practice your views. 2-5 year old girls are getting raped in this country. Colleges are filled with 10-20 goons. There isn’t anything wrong with the movie, you and I know what message our youngsters gonna interpret. I have two friends who committed suicide for love in college. “Tere Naam” is no distant memory either

3917	NGEN	a	Why is this fool talking when Madhu Kishwar is talking and why doesn't Arnab shut him up while she speaks.
3918	NGEN	a	Ranu.nice
3919	NGEN	a	Stupid !
3920	NGEN	a	The point is any negative character must not be projected as a hero and Kabir Singh is a character which is definitely showed doing bad activities but on the other hand if we focus the intention of the movie is also to project that whatever he is doing he remains a hero.
3921	NGEN	a	Shitwood
3922	NGEN	a	Aagya the most awaited video of all time
3923	NGEN	a	"Well the fact a celebrity or an icon has effects on viewers is very nicely depicted in Udta Punjab. Parents at home and teachers at schools should by all means have Moral and Etiquette development classes to have the overall development of an individual in order have a kind generous personality towards others so that one doesn't loose his or her that individuality at their very prone period called ""teenage"""
3924	NGEN	a	Cultural values are subjective... liberty stands for individualism...every individual should be able to take his decisions...now some can be happy to be with one person throughout life...or some can be happy to have multiple partners....it depends on individual... We misjudged liberty and bashing it... Feminism stands for equal right for female... We live in patriarchal society,where inequality stems the social control... society had controlled female through centuries... Removing this inequality is the goal of feminism.... Now Kabir Singh is just a film... creator have right to portray his/her story in their way... What to take away from this film? It depends on a person who is watching the film... Some can see it as a story... but some can feel that it glorifies Kabir Singh acts... Both perspective is right in their own domain... Just one think to remember, if you are not comfortable to watch then don't watch...

3933	NGEN	a	@Utkarsh Singh not all illiterates have ethics. It depends on a individuals sanskar and genetics. And what he/she has been exposed to since they were a child. For ex: an abusive father who would lay hands on his wife.
3934	NGEN	a	Thanks bro

3974	NGEN	a	@kritika he played for the same reason everybody who plays negative roles does so....because it is hrd to play such a character and tests the acting chops of the actor for eg:nawazuddin,some roles of srk and rajkumar.And just because you are playing a character does not mean that you like the character.Nawazuddin has spoken extensively on this topic that he does not like most of his character that he plays.

I am really surprised how you got that Brooker prize for writing the book? Did you hire someone to write the book? You are telling people to be dishonest. Who knows? You must have hired someone to write the book. It is so evident that honesty is not in your dictionary. Shame!!

3998	NGEN	a	And yes movies do affect human behaviour, especially if that human is an Indian. Long back there was a case in Australia where a man of Indian descent was charged for stalking and harassing a woman. He told the court that he learnt all that from bollywood movies and the court, on finding that bollywood does portray men and women in such a toxic manner, buried him. Yes, movies do affect our behaviour.

4000	NGEN	a	@Sneha sharma seems u r relating ur own tramautic personal life with the movie. Kabir singh is a great character. Only fault he had was short temper which created problem for him. Stop judging ppl based on ur own personal life

4003	NGEN	a	I love you Dada
4004	NGEN	a	Four more shots was hopeless.. I don't understand how people can like such bullshit.. I watched arjun reddy instead when kabir singh released. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. The acting was superb by vijay and shalini. Actually bollywood can not even come up with a really good story that they end up making remakes. What bollywood makes is shit like soty2, Race3, dhamaal, namaste England etc. No story only glamour and sex talks that's all.

4064	NGEN	a	Well Done , Best Review and Explaination
4065	NGEN	a	I am a girl I don't like that VDO.. The dialogues of the it's not a great thing
4066	NGEN	a	Liberals do not have problem with the movie but with Shahid Kapoor after he attended the swearing in ceremony of PM Modi. Shahid Kapoor is the latest target after Kangana Ranaut. Now onwards all his movies will be targeted.
4067	NGEN	a	Good analysis f the movies' story.
4068	NGEN	a	I was hating this movie to the core. Because people were all out making arjun reddy/kabir singh as hero and overlooking the self-destructive habits he had, in a way validating them. But the way you have tried to explain it, i want every viewer to take a note of this. That kabir singh is an imperfect human and we should realize every bad habit of his as bad and good traits of him should be appreciated too. Considering him so great, publicising him as a macho dude is in a way whitewashing every wrong thing in him and due to this i was very uncomfirtable. I cant see the youth taking inspiration from this and getting into drinking or drugs. There was no liberal or feminist agenda behind it. So not everthing is about liberalism or feminism.
4069	GEN	a	Well why can't u grasp that a guy can live however he wants, I myself would wear t-shirts & shorts to jobs instead of formal shirts as we can do what's comfortable & why can't a guy be topper? I pump & dump girls with consent yet never got less than 75% ever, well in those days seniors were respected like teachers & could do whatever they wanted with juniors so that's why juniors were treated like that in this movie
4070	NGEN	a	what is with kasturi's accent xD
4071	NGEN	a	Bro who hurt you?

4074	NGEN	a	Arundhati is a old ugly witch poisoning the mind of people to promote violence in India.

4227	NGEN	a	U r best bro
4228	NGEN	a	Seems like you have also watched Sucharita's review ! However, as a female I would have certainly wanted the lead actress to have bit stronger character. But critically speaking, this movie is solely based on an individual's story. The name itself is Kabir Singh. Secondly, we have seen such rowdy and complicated female characters in Hindi Movies, just like Tannu's character. Now without taking any sides, I would like to state that movies should be watched critically, and should never have emotional connection if we want to review. And I agree with your review and your explanation of the movie. This time I honestly watched the movie before watching any reviews. And it's a good movie with good character development. Good story line. And it's a story of an individual. This movie is solely meant for commercial success. And I am also not happy about the over critical feminist reviews. Thanks a lot for this review.
4229	NGEN	a	I'm 100% agree ..

4255	NGEN	a	With all due respect sir, I don't agree with you. I hope you take my opinion positively and provide feedback. There are many things wrong with this movie like kabir Singh marks preeti as his territory without asking her, are we all guys not taught to ask girls out properly. There are many guys who think it's okay to act this way, because preeti did not have a problem. But what if a girl says no, guys will take on their ego and harass a girl till she says Yes. I have sisters who faced this. This sends out a very wrong message, and guys learn it indirectly. That's why everyone is fighting for it. There are a lot of things wrong with other movies too, but Lets not take that and defend this movie. Lets pinpoint stuff if anything is wrong to get better content which can be entertaining.

4259	NGEN	a	Arundati is very rich where she get money who is paying her she looks depressed and senile
4260	NGEN	a	"People may criticize Pratik Borade by saying that he takes movies too seriously and always talks about ideologies instead of focusing on technical aspects. But ideology IS the most important thing. People in India are influenced by movies more than anything else. So if a movie is trying to promote negativity in society subliminally or openly it needs to be called out and criticised openly. Some will say ""Oh it is just a film."" But many people DO take these movies seriously and it does affect as well as change their lives. So though I disagree with Pratik regarding some movies, I hugely respect what he does. Filmmakers should not be allowed to create whatever bullshit they want to manipulate minds of youths, simply in the name of artistic freedom!"
