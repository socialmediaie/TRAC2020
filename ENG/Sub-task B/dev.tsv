2	GEN	a	sorry if i bother somebody.. iam a defence aspirant.. and i think that homosexual shouldn't be allowed to join army as a general duty personnel as we know that a different kind of atmosphere is there.. they have a very harsh routine there... abusing,hard workouts unbearable pain unbearable punishment and manhandling for severe mistakes(mainly in probation period) is normal... when such type of thing will happen to them they could get a feeling of discrimination(which is clearly not) however they can join clerical medical supply signal corps as upper mention hardness is of less magnitude there...

32	NGEN	a	My review-- I loved it. I loved the hell out of it. Not because I fanboy over Kabir Singh and his dominating ways. Not because I liked how he controlled over the entire college campus and marking the girl. No. If I'd met someone like Kabir Singh, I'd have never accepted him. I loved because of the storytelling itself. It wasn't a usual story of boy meets girl, face problems, get married, over. I loved how flawed both characters were because of which it felt so real at some parts. You could feel the emotions, the anxiety, the chemistry between the two leads. In many movies, you don't really feel for a couple. Like they r just put out there for the sake of the movie. But here they made sense in their own imperfect ways. I loved how flawed Kabir was. It made him more human. I hated his ways but over the course of time, so many things happen to him and he does Grow. I don't know why some critics think this movie is glorifying anger, macho behaviour, dominance and alcohol. In the movie, no one encourages to do these things. Infact, if I remember correctly, his parents, brother, friends, principal-- all of them tell him to STOP. They clearly state it's WRONG. And he faces the CONSEQUENCES for that. His temporary suspension from college, his father throwing him out of the house, a case registered against him, losing his medical license for a few years-- these were all the result of his behaviour and habits. Very later on, if these Kabir haters observed, they would see a GROWTH in his behaviour. He stops drinking, gathers a little patience and reflects on his life. If he was a totally shit character to you ppl, he wouldn't have told the truth during the court hearing. He wouldn't have felt guilty at all and would have continued to behave like that. Despite his issues, he cared for his patients. As for his behaviour with Preeti, he was sweet and loving with her, most of the time. Yes, he claimed her and all in the beginning, he never once FORCED her anything. Preeti wasn't obligated to anything, you see. If she didn't like going out with him, she would have refused it from the get go. But she clearly LIKED it. It was her personal choice. Kabir slapped her but Pretti slapped him too- Multiple times. It was Preeti who made the first move to kiss him. It was Preeti who begged him not to go. Was that Kabir doing it too? Both of them faced many things. They deserved their happy ending. If only two ppl in love were allowed to married in reality as well.

69	NGEN	a	I am not a kabir singh fan but i think you are stretching it too much.according to you movies and tv series like godfather,peaky blinders should never have been made as they glorify violence.evrything shouldn‚Äôt be connected to message and all.it‚Äôs irritating.akshya kumar is doing it nowadays and it‚Äôs so fucking irritating.
70	GEN	a	wow.... india is progressing day by day.... Now another responsibility for the indian parents to look husband for their sons and wife for their girls....... then gay couple will give birth children by surrogacy.... what will happen with the children who won't know who are their mother.. guys, please tell honestly, the children who see their father and mother in a complicated relation how they fell.... now how the children will fell when they will know the truth about their birth..... they won't get their mother's love..... why they would be deprived from the right to get love from their mother. their half of the relation will be cut down which are from their father's or mother's. You are supporting this heinous act. please, think deeply
71	NGEN	a	Like your contents...but you have got this totally wrong. There should not be any kind of sympathy or glorification of a character like Kabir Singh - he is everything that today's youth should not become - alcoholic, drug addict, zero respect for anyone , hitting people ... He is just one horror of a human being... And it is sad college goers get inspired and influenced by such things and get swayed by it and do all these things. Extremely sad. The only saving grace of the movie is Preethi...who however has hardly any screentime. This has got nothing to do with feminist or liberal backlash... Would anyone like one's own son or brother to be like Kabir Singh ?

If u're violent,if u scare people,if u have addictions,if u have wrong concepts of life and society..then u are not a human being.. irrespective of men/ women.. It's high time we rise above male and female and think about being human beings All my opinions are not based on the movie.. All that must be said is..Kabir Singh is a great story told in a great way..but Kabir should not be idolised in real life... he's a flawed man,look at him like a flawed man... don't try to find a hero in him And don't follow his path...and that's exactly the point of this movie...

Movies doesn't add up anything to it's consumers, it's just a way of exercising those part of our motives which we other ways can't implement in real life. Movies are just fantasy fillers. Yaa you can have some good points and topics and lessons from it, but at the end of the day, movies give you an opportunity and option to enjoy your fantasy. That's why every genre has its own particular audience, slasher movies, horror, romance, erotic, comedy, drama, superheroes, gore.

You demeaning feminists and not discriminating pseudo-feminists from the genuine ones really shows your mentality. I really respected you sir but I don‚Äôt respect you disrespecting feminists and disregarding the blatant internalized misogyny in the movie. It most likely wouldn‚Äôt matter to you, but you just lost a subscriber. I highly suggest you read deeper into these issues and analyze them more than on the surface level. We are all on this journey to unlearn societal norms and conditioning so I hope we all do so soon. God bless.

In Hinduism, Arjun and Subhadra were cousins and they got married, Krishna had 2 wives (out of his 16108 wives) who were his cousins named Mitravrinda and Bhadra. Yama and Yamuna had sexual relationship according to Hindu mythology and they were direct siblings. In South India cousin marriage is legal among high caste Hindus. Some stupid illiterate Hindus are barking here without knowing about their own religious custom. I was born in a Hindu family and I embraced Islam. Alhamdulillah I am a proud Muslim now. I invite all my Hindu brothers and sisters to join the religion of Peace. Laa Ilaaha Illallah Muhammadur Rasulullah. There is no god but ALLAH and Muhammad [peace be upon him] is the messenger of ALLAH. ALLAHU AKBAR. May ALLAH give you Hidayat. May all of you embrace Islam soon. Ameen!

Though I'm not feminist but basic rights without discrimination on caste, colour, religion, ethnicity & gender is cornerstone of human civilization, but sorry to say all the right wingers around the world always tries to crush these human rights in the name of culture, tradition, believes & society. I think all of us must have that much generosity so that we never forget basic human values. Thanks,

313	NGEN	a	Paul it is reality in India. Indian women marry for prestige while Indian men marry for money/dowry and convenience. It's usually never for love. Indian men kill their wives for burning the dinner, not paying their full dowry or any list of reasons every year. If you knew about Indian society, this film would not shock you at all.
314	NGEN	a	u have no idea what feminism stands for. veery di wedding, lust stories are not correct representative of feminist idea. Ask a girl who get harrassed by autowalas ricksawalas who tries to emulate kabir singh like characters. indians r not literate enough to discriminate between reel and real. I hope ur sister meet some kabir singh in real life than u might be able to understand the horror of glorification of such chacrater . what is heart breaking is so many people in comment section ascribing to his flawed idea about what feminism stand for. whats wrong with india. do u guys really support this. do u support domestic violence and other atrocities against women. heart breaking seriously.

We can't blame others.. Because Bollywood is making their future and don't care what we are becoming, and their is nothing wrong with this. So it totally depend on us...
324	NGEN	a	Although nothing worng in kabir singh but you are here to do movie review not to do hate speeches. i am seeing you from long time at start you were good but now you just do politics rather then reviewing movies.

325	GEN	a	"Well done .He is the lucky one who got his revenge and taught a good lesson to that bitch and their family members who filed false case against him.Now this is the only way left for justice in india.Now indian bitches will marry to innocent man to make shortcut money and have their husband as slave.If man denies to be a slave of her then he and his famly will be threaten by false dowry case and ask millions of money in revenge. PROSTITUTES ARE MUCH MUCH BETTER THEN THESE MARRIED BITCHES, at least these prostitutes makes money in a honest way and do not cheat their customers and do not spoil their family at all but these bitches asks millions in the favors of getting fucked for few nights and their parents who are retired and brother who is in drugs and do not make any money then for these basterds teach this bitch girl to marry a innocent guy and get fucked for few nights and then fuck their in laws family by putting false dowry case so brides family can feed their self with the money got as compromise called ""REVERSE DOWRY "".After getting money as settlement these bitches and their family starts hunting for another man .Indian judicial system knows everything but do not want to do anything and makes money out of it..sure every one will get lesson because every one has son and daughter and their daughter in law files the same dawry case against their son then they will realize and learn the lesson.The people are too scared to marry a girl once get married and if threaten by girl to file false case then it will happen that people will kill her and her family before going to jail after all once they charged in false dowry case then there is no chance left for compromise except kill them all as only left option as JUSTICE .so now its upto indian court what they want? do they want to keep these bitches filling false case one by one and get killed by their husband ???or court will have the option to do proper investigartion before arrest and if the bride is convicted then file the case against her and her family and give them life imprisonment because death penelty is too less for them..God save india from these prostitute married bitches."

All people are not like that. I have seen far weaker character than priya and more destructive character than Kabir singh in real life. Surrealism is less wonderful than realism.

420	NGEN	a	Jahangir did the right thing. She's responsible for her family's murder. Finally she has been taught a lesson.
421	NGEN	a	Actually, we medicos loved only Songs and Shahid Acting in that Film. In other aspects, it was just like another typical Bollywood film nothing else.
422	NGEN	a	Nice..
423	NGEN	a	Gd bro
424	NGEN	a	Haven't seen the movie yet but watched some interviews etc . I just want to say one thing . In a relationship few things are definitely toxic like physical abuse . Doesn't matter if the guy does it or the girl it's still wrong . May be the movie didn't justify kabir's action but the director did . He said something like both the partners should have the liberty to touch each other & even slap & express their anger etc. which is wrong according to me ! And I have a problem wiith how he tried to justify it . The scene is supposed to show how the character handled the situation not how it should be handled & justifying it does the latter .
425	NGEN	a	Good analysis üëç
426	NGEN	a	Finally u uploaded which I wanted
427	NGEN	a	Disturbing to see this lady (Arundati Roy) instigating people to lie and provide fake details. She is a disgrace to the nation. She should be given exemplary punishment so as to deter others from misleading people.

477	NGEN	a	Arnab, or people like Arundhati Roy are sponsored by enemies of India to keep India from making progress. People like her should not be given any importance and should be charged so that they are accountable for their seditious actions and speech.
478	NGEN	a	I Also Thought After Movie That This Was Other **BOLLYWOOD** Movie .
479	NGEN	a	Arundhati must be tried for preaching Violence. Congress should be disbanded as Requested by Gandhiji

487	NGEN	a	Giving false information to public servant during official survey when one is required by law to give true information is an offence under Indian penal code. She also asked for throwing away an elected govt and not to allow it complete it's term of further 4 years . What do you say lallantop?
488	NGEN	a	Sir first of all clear all your thoughts about liberals & feminist. You are criticizing people by giving them a name & making stereotypes that feminism & liberals only stand against what all India wants. You have got good number of followers please for God's sake stop making stereotypes because ppl watching will come out & call every girl a bad feminist. Second point: I never watched 4 more shots because when I watched the trailer I myself as a girl found out to be wrong therefore i didn't even watch the whole series unlike you. You can't compare a web series with a film. Films are meant to put impact on people & what Kabir Singh shows is disgusting because he kept on calling preeti ki she is my Bandi she doesn't have her own personality (i know why you ppl liked this movie because it's India). Third: Do you liked movie veere di wedding??????? As a girl I didn't watch movie because it literally showed girls being a bit more sort of bad. You ppl still comment on Swara Bhaskar's masturbation scene & troll her despite of her acting. So my request is go get a life & stop differentiating people by calling them liberals. Don't make stereotypes as simple as that.
489	NGEN	a	I can see that this is not the correct movie for you bhai üòÅüòÅ it's ok I can understand your opinion but I feel in this movie that hero himself is villan of himself because of his mistakes he suffered lost his job lost his Identity and almost lost his love but later he realized what mistake he had done and came for his love. I can understand the doubts you have for the character please try to watch deleted scene for Kabir Singh in YouTube then you may somewhat hate it little lessüòÅüòÅ

496	NGEN	a	What a stupid comment Precisely why it's a movie So is Hollywood showing reality?
497	NGEN	a	Nupur sharma did a Smriti Irani over here by alleging that Arundhati Roy is imploring the people to name themselves after convicts of a murder-rape case of 1978 , I mean I wasn't aware of this connection of Ranga-billa until she brought it up. The levels of drama in these BJP people is something else.
498	NGEN	a	Arundathi looks like always high on cocaine
499	NGEN	a	I agree woth you 100%
500	NGEN	a	Is it necessary to drag liberalism everywhere? If you really want to understand, what is liberalism? Read the book A theory of justice by John Rawls that will increase your knowledge about liberalism.
501	NGEN	a	Hahahahaha
502	NGEN	a	These fake feminist have no idea what are the ground problems faced by women in reality. They are the people who have all kind of luxuries in life. Playing feminist feminist is their way of making themselves feel intellectual. Wether it be misogynist or feminist both are equally dangerous for a society to progress. If something is wrong to be done with a girl then it goes same for a boy. If you really want to create a society of equal rights for women then plz understand that liberalisation is not just in having multiple affairs or wearing shorts or drinking alcohol. There are lot more serious issues related to women. As far as arjun reddy is concerned it's a masterpiece. And yes I am a woman.

533	NGEN	a	The problem isn't about viewing this film logically or emotionally. The problem lies in the portrayal of the male character. The writer wanted to show that Kabir Singh is aggressive. That's okay. But it's not okay to glorify that behaviour. When he dominates over a girl, doesn't respect her privacy and literally thinks that what ever he does is right and all those actions are not condemned is where the writer goes wrong.

624	NGEN	a	These stupid indian faminists watch stupid american faminists on youtube and try to imitate them
625	NGEN	a	Idk..... I mean how come you say that preeti is pregnant and he is not judgemental..... Cause he is a flawfull person..... His anger issue drove him towards alcohol and drugs.... At some point he is not at all control his emotions and his gonna be parent..... Father.... How come preeti don't consider that.... He is frustrated..... He can't be a good father... Even he can't be a good boyfriend also.... When preeti needs him most he just doing wrong things just because of anger...... I can be sympathetic for that person but can he really eligible for being a father???? The last part actually make me feel that it kinda lame.... I think Debdas has the better ending....

646	NGEN	a	Bhai entire Indian entertainment industry is getting spoiled day by day. In name of TV shows we have bullshit, web series is full of Gali galoch and sex and reality show is out of reality. Our movies have always shown us faltu ka pyaar.... Bollywood assumes that entire Indian audience is dumbass and show them anything. That's why most of the movies in recent past have turned out to be a disaster at the box office irrespective of their starcast. I hope they realise the gravity of the situation and think little bit maturely.
647	NGEN	a	This video is crappy in a way for they've stereotyped 'same sex relationships' with wholesome stigmas. YOU CANNOT PROMOTE THESE KINDS OF VIDEOS THAT MAKE NO SENSE RELATED TO LGBTQ+ CONTEXT but are using queer liberation as rainbow capitalism.
648	NGEN	a	@Anchal Kumar calling a particular character poorly written doesn't make one FAR left . Her character is laughable regardless of gender

659	NGEN	a	You are absolutely right sir
660	NGEN	a	@sanjeev misra in the movie also the character was showing his emotions but that was not the correct way to show anyone's emotions. There are lot of abuses which don't include mother, sister abuses.
661	NGEN	a	Sexual orientation is natural so don't judge them...they have their own choice...
662	NGEN	a	I still cannot believe and understand that who has made her a celebrity author and writer. Kind of language she is using against elected Indian government under the guise of freedom of speech is a matter of great concern and shame to all of us.

684	NGEN	a	Yes dada
685	NGEN	a	Soumya Mukherjee HI.
686	NGEN	a	Too much dramatic but ultimately good message for the society.
687	NGEN	a	This type of movies are threat to our society. Freedom to make any type of movie but with greater logic and ending should be justified well. Emotions are not that realistic to fall for it. Emotions was more like assumption which i can't digest. Theme of the movie matters a lot too. This type of movies are too many in Bollywood industry which is way too old concept.
688	NGEN	a	RiteüòÄüòÅ
689	NGEN	a	Fuck off libtars and chutiyanists.
690	NGEN	a	Very niceüòçüòç
691	GEN	a	LGBT judgement is not in a proper way and it makes this judgement very very danger for society. Those who come in this category should be congratulated, but this judgement is a open judgement that who ever want to do anything can do.. is wrong judgement. There are people who are involved in this just because of their lust.. they want something extra in sex...they want sex in other ways also... this is an extra desire and there is no full stop and it will never end. The next result or demand of this judgement will be to give permission to move naked on street...and next will be to allow having sex in open space without public ... and next will be to allow sex in public places and so on......About the rights given to this category should be equal as a normal people. They should not be treated as a second planet people...
692	NGEN	a	Arundhati Roy needs a JAIL as her Permanent Home to end her anti-national Activities that provocate other anti-nationals to come on roads destroying public and private properties. She needs third-degree treatment.

706	NGEN	a	The 'fly by night' operators like Arundhati Roy, who is full of herself, is objecting to population analysis survey fearing that the spread of the Abrahamic religion in the North East part of India would be revealed. She is probably being jet in for this purpose by people with nefarious intentions elsewhere.

Watched the show after watching your review. The show was amazing. I couldn't sleep after watching first 2 episodes. Binge watched it. Keep up the good work.
740	NGEN	a	Movie is just a director's individual story and view...... liberals or conservatives both bad...... Nice movie.... shahid acting best... Best director.... But don't be drug addict, alcoholic and anger.... watch movie but don't follow it......
741	GEN	a	What a disgrace its not moving anything forward just the opposite its a regression. Homosexual lifestyle is the most destructive and unhealthy lifestyle according to world health organization and is a sign of moral decay in that society, just like the Roman Empire. It is a degrading lifestyle. God had it right a man is for woman and woman for man. This lifestyle degrades manhood and womanhood of the individual.
742	NGEN	a	Seems they just paid intellectuals. Their only moto is destruction and breaking of India. Government should out such people behind bars. No mercy.

773	NGEN	a	This new visual format with one proponent and one opponent on the screen at any time and lower decibels is a significant improvement over the old one where everyone was shown and talked at once.

826	NGEN	a	Superb analysis
827	NGEN	a	You did talk too much brother about liberals ...n you sounded like extremist..but i agree about the movie..i loved that movie...
828	NGEN	a	"Once again..off the mark..its not necessary to look at everything from a feminist or libtard viewpoint.Grow up. Call a spade a spade. What the makers are trying to do,as films mostly do, is glorify violence sex and crime. They want to shock you and awe you. The lead actor is performing obscene and irresponsible actions. You might just enjoy the ride but such movies impact the juevenile mind adversely. The innumerable rapes and acid attacks happen to women by such ""committed"" lovers,no?"

835	NGEN	a	I am not a feminist. But I hate this movie. Aur ha Gadhe no one opposing love between them. The approach by the guy was wrong. If anyone come to me and try to claim that I am his, for me it would be like bully. I would slap him complain about him. And yes if actress of this movie would do sluty things I would not approve of that. Wrong is wrong either by man or woman. I also do not support movie like Pink. Where women drinks do drugs and willingly go with men in hotel. But if later something wrong happens with them, they say no means no. I also do not support your video. It's a third class attempt to save a third class movie. And also if anyone gives review on my body in front of whole fucking class then i would beat the hell out of that man. You are defending that man who is literally running after woman to beat her. That man needs medication. How the hell he is even working at any hospital? Why didn't he got suspended from medical college? Uske father ki place hai kya ki wo kuch bhi karsakta hai.
836	NGEN	a	Love you shwetabh bhai....Please make a video on shadi mein jaror aana movie too. And give your views on that movie also

Be neutral. Afzal, Hafiz , kasab are terroristthere is no doubt. At the same time admit pragya too belongs to same group. U people have made a terrorist sitting in parliament. Very shameful
844	NGEN	a	Right.....
845	NGEN	a	Y u r afraid of hindu Muslims.....???? It's a truth how far u il run from this truth....? A true educated people will look into matter not hide it ..... Islam is threat to humanity .... Sooner we realise better it would be for world.

I have already boycotted news channels from last 2 years.......and know many people have done so....unless people who like to hear useless or masala made news.. It would be really nice if Mr.Arnab would use his talent to highlight and expose the real hidden issues of our country....... Lost complete faith in media....except few youtubers who still does their job with honesty......bringing out truth in public.... What Ms.Roy has said....all started judging her......but what our honorable prime minister said no media would have ever bothered to debate on that matter........

983	NGEN	a	"I regret for commenting on your review of movie ""Period. end of sentence"" & somehow becoming a part of your another video by giving you genuine content. I was fool enough to be actually a liberal & not to judge anyone based on their political ideology. This review of yours confirms that either you are also toxic man who might have beaten women or you are supporting movie only because some anti modi people criticized it (this reason is even worst)Moreover, being a feminist or liberal has nothing to do with political party or ideology. I am proud liberal & feminist who don't support extremists or separatist who support Afzal or Burhan as well as another bunch of extremist like you who will defend even a rapist may be, just to be anti feminist. Shame on you for supporting a character who is kissing & misusing a fresher without her consent but at the end he is shown as true lover. People like this are main reason behind rapes & domestic violence & it's supporter like you are also part of it. People like you are biggest hypocrite because you people will start blabbering about Sanskar after watching 4 more shorts or Veere di wedding but proudly defend a toxic masculinity character. If you are really honest person then just for few minutes imagine a senior of your sister treating her like this in the name of love. Will you let your sister to marry him at the end if she tells you that she is sorry for all this toxicity?? Do answer if you will really be comfortable. Making movie on such character & glorifying it are two different thing."
984	GEN	a	all homosexuals are paedophiles according to the Bible genesis 19 ( we don't want paedophiles in Indian army ( Bible is true word God burned all homosexuals with fire and brimstone) I agree with major vipin maybe God trying to warn Indians through major vipin that be careful before God destroy Indian army because God's angry on homosexuals forever.

999	NGEN	a	The same points can be levied on the video games cause violence debate which have been debunked by various studies. Effect of art on people is there but not in a significant way. Generally what happens is people relate to behaviors they already have in cinema and not that they get thier behavior from cinema. That's the issue. Not the other way around.
